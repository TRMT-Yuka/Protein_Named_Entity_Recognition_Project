The inflammatory bowel diseases Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are common, chronic disorders that cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal bleeding. To identify genetic factors that might contribute to these disorders, we performed a genome-wide association study. We found a highly significant association between Crohn's disease and the IL23R gene on chromosome 1p31, which encodes a subunit of the receptor for the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-23. An uncommon coding variant (rs11209026, c.1142G&gt;A, p.Arg381Gln) confers strong protection against Crohn's disease, and additional noncoding IL23R variants are independently associated. Replication studies confirmed IL23R associations in independent cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. These results and previous studies on the proinflammatory role of IL-23 prioritize this signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in inflammatory bowel disease.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="608" length="9"></location><text>c.1142G&gt;A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="619" length="11"></location><text>p.Arg381Gln</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11209026</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11209026</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17455201</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of DLG5 variants with inflammatory bowel disease in the New Zealand Caucasian population and meta-analysis of the DLG5 R30Q variant.		BACKGROUND: Variants in the DLG5 gene have been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in samples from some, but not all populations. In particular, 2 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), R30Q (rs1248696) and P1371Q (rs2289310), have been associated with an increased risk of IBD, and a common haplotype (called haplotype "A") has been associated with reduced risk. METHODS: We genotyped R30Q, P1371Q, and a haplotype A tagging SNP (rs2289311) in a New Zealand Caucasian cohort of 389 Crohn's disease (CD) patients, 406 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 416 population controls. Each SNP was tested for association with disease susceptibility and clinical phenotypes. We also performed a meta-analysis of R30Q data from published association studies. RESULTS: The haplotype A tagging SNP was associated with reduced risk of IBD at the 0.05 significance level (P=0.036) with an allelic odds ratio of 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.99). Association with haplotype A was strongest (odds ratio approximately 0.57) in UC patients with familial IBD or extraintestinal manifestations. The R30Q and P1371Q polymorphisms were not significantly associated with UC, CD, or IBD. Analysis of male and female data did not find any gender-specific associations. Meta-analysis gave no evidence of association of R30Q with IBD. CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis demonstrates that the minor allele of R30Q is not a risk factor for IBD across populations. This study provides some evidence that DLG5 haplotype A is associated with reduced risk of IBD in the New Zealand Caucasian population, but this association will need to be replicated in an independent sample.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="382" length="6"></location><text>P1371Q</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="131" length="4"></location><text>R30Q</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2289310</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1248696</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18300940</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Polymorphisms of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor gene: association with maldescended testes and male infertility.		OBJECTIVE: Maldescended testes are the most common genital anomaly in newborns and are associated with testicular malignancy and infertility. As the inguinoscrotal phase of testis descent is androgen-dependent and requires integrity of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LHCGR), we investigated whether nonsynonymous polymorphisms of the LHCGR gene are associated with maldescended testes. METHODS: This was a retrospective case-control study including 278 patients with maldescended testes, 277 infertile men without maldescensus and 271 controls with normal sperm concentrations. Clinical and endocrinological workup of the patients was performed. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was performed by GeneScan and TaqMan technology. RESULTS: Men with maldescended testes had significantly lower testis volumes, higher serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) but similar testosterone levels compared with both the control groups. The insLQ polymorphism in exon 1 (rs4539842) and the N291S SNP in exon 10 (rs12470652), showing increased receptor sensitivity in vitro, were not differently distributed between patients and controls. The S312N SNP in exon 10 (rs2293275) was significantly less frequent in men with maldescended testes than in controls. This difference was confirmed when infertile men with and without maldescensus were considered together. CONCLUSIONS: In men with maldescensus, a high LH drive maintains normal testosterone levels but this LH resistance is not associated with any particular LHCGR genotype. A significant association with the S312N polymorphism in exon 10 of the LHCGR is correlated to the spermatogenetic damage rather than to the maldescensus itself. Either the LHCGR itself or another genomic region linked to this SNP, possibly the germ cell-specific TFIIA-alpha/beta-like factor gene transcribed from the same genomic region in the opposite direction, is a risk factor for male infertility.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1185" length="5"></location><text>N291S</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1337" length="5"></location><text>S312N</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs12470652</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2293275</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17389014</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Epistatic interaction between FCRL3 and MHC in Spanish patients with IBD.		Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which comprises ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), shows a multifactorial origin, with genetic and environmental factors involved. Although the genetic influence is clear for both diseases, the genetics involved is complex and epistatic interactions with other genes probably exist. The Fc receptor-like 3 gene (FCRL3) maps to the human chromosome 1q21-22 and certain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in its promoter have been associated with some autoimmune diseases. Our aim was to study the role of two promoter SNPs of the FCRL3 gene (-169A&gt;G, rs7528684 and -110C&gt;T, rs11264799) in patients with IBD and their interaction with HLA-DRB1 and CARD15 in patients with UC and CD, respectively. A case-control study with 311 patients with CD, 324 patients with UC and 497 healthy controls was performed. All the individuals were White Spaniards. No significant associations were found between any FCRL3 SNP and CD or UC, but the stratification in patients with UC by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) showed a significant increase in heterozygosity at the FCRL3 locus, especially -169 AG (AG vs AA+GG, P= 0.0027, odds ratio = 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.4-2.9), when HLA-DRB1*0103 carrier patients were compared with HLA-DRB1*0103 noncarriers. Our data suggest an epistatic interaction between genes in chromosomes 6p21 and 1q21-22, marked, respectively, by HLA-DRB1*0103 and FCRL3-169 AG.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="692" length="7"></location><text>-110C&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="669" length="7"></location><text>-169A&gt;G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11264799</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs7528684</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18303971</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Glutathione S-transferase GSTT1 and GSTM1 allozymes: beyond null alleles.		Moyer AM, Salavaggione OE, Hebbring SJ et al.: Glutathione S-transferase T1 and M1: gene sequence variation and functional genomics. Clin. Cancer Res. 13, 7207-7216 (2007). Genetic variations in the glutathione S-transferases GSTT1 and GSTM1 have been studied in many human populations, and association of these variations with environmentally-related cancers, drug-induced hepatotoxicity and even chronification of viral hepatitis has been shown. However, studies carried out to date have been limited to gene deletion, designated as null alleles, and no extensive studies on other types of genetic variations have been carried out. This study is of great importance, as it describes the occurrence and the allele frequencies for 18 SNPs in the GSTT1 gene, including four nonsynonymous SNPs, and 69 SNPs, two of which are nonsynonymous, in the GSTM1 gene. The GSTT1 SNPs leading to the amino acid substitutions Asp43Asn, Thr65Met, Thr104Pro and a single nucleotide deletion in exon 4 cause a decrease in immunoreactive protein. Interestingly, the previously described nonsynonymous GSTT1 SNPs rs2266635 (Ala21Thr), rs11550606 (Leu30Pro), rs17856199 (Phe45Cys), rs11550605 (Thr104Pro), rs2266633 (Asp141Asn) and rs2234953 (Glu173Lys) were not identified in 400 subjects, thus indicating that these variant alleles are expected to occur at extremely low frequencies. This study reinforces the need to combine SNP databases and resequencing. On combining the data reported in this study with SNP databases, the most promising target SNPs for GSTT1 association studies are those causing the amino acid changes Asp43Asn, Thr65Met, Thr104Pro and the single nucleotide deletion in exon 4. These gene variants should be analyzed in African-American and Hispanic subjects to increase the predictive capacity of genetic tests. For Caucasians and Oriental subjects, testing for null alleles seems to be sufficient.</text><annotation id="T6"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1007" length="9"></location><text>Thr104Pro</text></annotation><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1203" length="8"></location><text>Leu30Pro</text></annotation><annotation id="T5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1226" length="8"></location><text>Phe45Cys</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1180" length="8"></location><text>Ala21Thr</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1298" length="9"></location><text>Glu173Lys</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1272" length="9"></location><text>Asp141Asn</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2266635</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2266633</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#6"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11550605</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T6" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs17856199</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T5" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11550606</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2234953</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17293537</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic variants in brain-derived neurotrophic factor associated with Alzheimer's disease.		BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is complex, with variants in multiple genes contributing to interactions increasing risk for the disease. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) promotes neuronal survival and modulates hippocampal-dependent memory. METHODS: We examined 11 SNPs that spanned the gene on chromosome 11p14 in 220 Alzheimer's patients and 128 control spouses. RESULTS: Not all of the SNPs were informative, due to minor allele frequencies of &lt;2%. Neither C270T nor two SNPs that reside proximal to exon V had significant association with the disease. However, we did find that the heterozygous form of the rs6265 SNP (Val66Met), as well as the diplotype of three SNPs (rs6265, rs11030104, rs2049045; H1-GTC/H2-ACG) all were highly significant in APOE 4 non-carriers (OR = 2.734; p = 0.0096). CONCLUSION: The combination of the diplotypes for three SNPs exhibited significant p values for Alzheimer's APOE 4 non-carriers. The two SNPs (rs11030104 and rs2049045) are found between exons VI and VII, while the Val66Met polymorphism is located in the coding exon VIII; the total distance for the three SNPs is 14308 bp. Whether the SNPs are involved with alternative splicing of the VII/VIII transcript is of considerable interest.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="724" length="8"></location><text>Val66Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6265</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17955236</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Influence of the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene (NOS2A) on inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility.		The great amount of nitric oxide (NO) produced by the inducible isoform of NO synthase (iNOS) exerts deleterious effects, and iNOS expression is raised in the colonic mucosa of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. This is the first association analysis of polymorphisms within the NOS2A extended gene with IBD susceptibility. We analyzed 336 patients of Crohn's disease (CD), 355 of ulcerative colitis (UC), and 536 healthy controls from a Spanish population. We tested a (CCTTT)n microsatellite, a (-/TAAA) insertion, and two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) flanking them (rs2779251 and rs2779248) in the NOS2A promoter, together with two SNPs in the coding region: one within exon 10, D385D (rs1137933), and another mapping to exon 16, S608L (rs2297518). Analysis of these markers evidenced differences among IBD patients and healthy controls. Allele (CCTTT) 13 is related to higher UC risk (p = 0.001; odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval, CI] = 1.64 [1.20-2.23]). Carriers of minor alleles of the two promoter SNPs analyzed showed an association with UC predisposition, and common allele homozygotes of the two exonic SNPs were more frequent among CD patients than among controls. Concordantly, one out of the three haplotypes carrying both exonic risk alleles was found to increase CD susceptibility (p = 0.007; OR [95%CI] = 1.74 [1.13-2.67]). Therefore, the NOS2A gene seems to be involved in IBD aetiology.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="809" length="5"></location><text>D385D</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="860" length="5"></location><text>S608L</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1137933</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2297518</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16652158</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A novel T-77C polymorphism in DNA repair gene XRCC1 contributes to diminished promoter activity and increased risk of non-small cell lung cancer.		X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1) plays a key role in DNA base excision repair and cells lacking its activity are hypersensitive to DNA damage. Recently, we reported a SNP (rs3213245, -77T&gt;C) in the XRCC1 gene 5' untranslated region (UTR) was significantly associated with the risk of developing esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma. Computer analysis predicted that this SNP was in the core of Sp1-binding motif, which suggested its functional significance. Gel shift and super shift assays confirmed that -77T&gt;C polymorphic site in the XRCC1 promoter was within the Sp1-binding motif and the T&gt;C substitution greatly enhanced the binding affinity of Sp1 to this region. Luciferase assays indicated that the Sp1-high-affinity C-allelic XRCC1 promoter was associated with a reduced transcriptional activity. The association between -77T&gt;C and three other amino-acid substitution-causing polymorphisms in XRCC1 and risk of lung cancer was examined in 1024 patients and 1118 controls and the results showed that only the -77T&gt;C polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of developing lung cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that an increased risk of lung cancer was associated with the variant XRCC1 -77 genotypes (TC and CC) compared with the TT genotype (OR=1.46, 95% CI=1.18-1.82; P=0.001) and the increased risk was more pronounced in smokers (OR=1.63, 95% CI=1.20-2.21) than in non-smokers (OR=1.28, 95% CI=0.94-1.76). Taken together, these results showed that the functional SNP -77T&gt;C in XRCC1 5'UTR was associated with cancer development owing to the decreased transcriptional activity of C-allele-containing promoter with higher affinity to Sp1 binding.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="8" length="5"></location><text>T-77C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3213245</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16723442</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A prospective assessment of the Y402H variant in complement factor H, genetic variants in C-reactive protein, and risk of age-related macular degeneration.		PURPOSE: Two biologically related factors, complement factor H (CFH) and C-reactive protein (CRP), have been associated with AMD. The Y402H variant of CFH is located within the binding site of CFH for CRP. Although plasma CRP levels have been related to AMD and plasma CRP levels are partly determined by genetic variation, there is no information on whether genetic variants in CRP are associated with AMD. METHODS: A prospective analysis was performed of 111 men who eventually developed AMD and 401 men who remained free of AMD, all participants in the Physicians' Health Study. Genotypes were determined for the common T--&gt;C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 9 of CFH (rs1061170; protein Y402H), as well as seven previously described CRP SNPs (rs3093059, rs2794521, rs3091244, rs1417938, rs1800947, rs1130864, and rs1205). Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate individual SNPs, as well as six CRP haplotypes for association with AMD. RESULTS: The high-risk C allele of CFH was present in 45% of cases and 34% of controls. An odds ratio (OR) of 1.46 was observed for AMD (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-2.04) for TC heterozygotes and an OR of 2.13 (95% CI: 1.10-4.16) for CC homozygotes, assuming a multiplicative (log-additive) model and attributable fraction of 25% (95% CI: 1% to 44%) was calculated. For CRP, single-marker or haplotype-based analysis failed to reveal any significant associations with a risk of AMD. CONCLUSIONS: These prospective data confirmed an association between the Y402H variant of CFH and a risk of AMD. In contrast, although a biologically plausible, genetic variation in CRP does not appear to be associated with a risk of AMD. Further prospective studies of a larger number of subjects are needed to substantiate available information on the genetic epidemiology of AMD.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="32" length="5"></location><text>Y402H</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1061170</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16179580</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Estrogen receptor alpha gene variation and the risk of stroke.		BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) gene variation is associated with a range of important estrogen-dependent characteristics, including responses of lipid profile and atherosclerotic severity to hormone replacement therapy, coronary heart disease risk, and migraine. The roles that reproductive steroids play in cerebrovascular pathophysiology and ischemia are an important area of investigation. Given that there is a significantly higher risk of myocardial infarction among men with the CC genotype (PP of PvuII) of c.454-397T&gt;C (rs2234693), we asked whether this genotype is associated with a higher risk of stroke. METHODS: Relative risk of stroke by genotype was determined in 2709 participants of the Second Northwick Park Heart Study, white males with a mean baseline age 56 years and follow up 10.5 years. RESULTS: Compared with participants with the ESR1 c.454-397CT or TT genotype, those with the CC genotype had a relative risk of stroke of 1.92 (95% confidence interval, 1.06 to 3.48, P=0.03) after adjustment for age, primary care practice; additional adjustment for body mass index, serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking status. Exclusion of stroke cases with coronary heart disease gave results that were essentially unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, subjects with the common ESR1 c.454-397CC genotype have a substantial increase in risk of stroke. In another publication, other ESR1 variation was associated with migraine. We thus hypothesize that estrogen receptor variation may provide a basis for the established relationship among estrogens, migraine, and stroke.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="602" length="12"></location><text>c.454-397T&gt;C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2234693</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16783862</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>PPAR-gamma gene polymorphisms and psoriatic arthritis.		OBJECTIVE: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) activation has been shown to play a role in suppressing angiogenesis and inflammation, both important pathological features of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Given the potential physiological role for PPAR-gamma in PsA, we examined known coding polymorphisms in the PPAR-gamma gene in a Caucasian population. METHODS: PsA was diagnosed as an inflammatory arthritis in patients with psoriasis, in the absence of other etiologies for inflammatory arthritis. Control subjects were ascertained from the same population and were all Caucasian. DNA samples were genotyped for 4 PPAR-gamma variants by time-of-flight mass spectrometry using the Sequenom platform. All 4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were previously-reported coding variations, 3 of which caused an amino acid change: Pro12Ala (rs1801282), Pro40Ala (rs1805192), and Pro115Gln (rs1800571); the fourth SNP, C161T (rs3856806), was synonymous. All primers were designed using Sequenom SpectroDesigner software, and scanned using a mass spectrometry workstation. RESULTS: Of the 4 SNP examined, Pro40Ala and Pro115Gln were found to be nonpolymorphic in our population. Minor allele frequency for patients with PsA and controls for Pro12Ala (G) were 9.0% vs 13.8% (p = 0.017) and for C161T (T) 10.7% vs 12.0% (p = 0.56), respectively. All genotypes satisfied Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. CONCLUSION: An association between PsA and a known coding SNP of the PPAR-gamma gene was observed in our Caucasian population.

BACKGROUND: Variation in the perception of bitter tastes has been associated with eating behavior, body composition, and cardiovascular disease. Recent observations have implicated 2 common haplotypes of TAS2R38 in the determination of bitter compound-tasting ability. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study were to examine, in the British Women's Heart and Health Study cohort, any association between TAS2R38 haplotypes, coronary heart disease (CHD), CHD risk factors, and eating behavior and to examine whether the associations allow for estimation of the effects of variation in diet on the etiology of common disease. DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study of relations between TAS2R38 haplotypes and CHD, CHD risk factors, and eating behavior in 3383 women from 23 British towns. RESULTS: Genotyping at P49A and V262A in TAS2R38 (rs713598 and rs1726866) allowed construction of all 4 possible haplotypes. The 2 most common haplotypes corresponded with previously identified haplotypes related to bitter compound-tasting ability. No substantial evidence of association was found between these haplotypes and CHD (odds ratio for taste-defining haplotypes: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.2), body mass index (difference between means of taste-defining haplotypes: -0.084; 95% CI: -0.45, 0.29), or a series of physiologic and dietary characteristics. A marginally lower risk of diabetes was observed among those with the nontaster haplotype than among those with the taster haplotype (odds ratio: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.48, 1.00). CONCLUSION: TAS2R38 status was not an important determinant of CHD, related risk factors, or eating behavior in the British Women's Heart and Health Study sample.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="956" length="4"></location><text>P49A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="965" length="5"></location><text>V262A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs713598</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1726866</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16103896</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>An association study of 43 SNPs in 16 candidate genes with atorvastatin response.		Variation in individual response to statin therapy has been widely studied for a potential genetic component. Multiple genes have been identified as potential modulators of statin response, but few study findings have replicated. To further examine these associations, 2735 individuals on statin therapy, half on atorvastatin and the other half divided among fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin were genotyped for 43 SNPs in 16 genes that have been implicated in statin response. Associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering, total cholesterol lowering, HDL-C elevation and triglyceride lowering were examined. The only significant associations with LDL-C lowering were found with apoE2 in which carriers of the rare allele who took atorvastatin lowered their LDL-C by 3.5% more than those homozygous for the common allele and with rs2032582 (S893A in ABCB1) in which the two groups of homozygotes differed by 3% in LDL-C lowering. These genetic effects were smaller than those observed with the demographic variables of age and gender. The magnitude of all the differences found is sufficiently small that genetic data from these genes should not influence clinical decisions on statin administration.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="969" length="5"></location><text>S893A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2032582</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17674045</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>No association between MDR1 (ABCB1) 2677G&gt;T and 3435C&gt;T polymorphism and sporadic colorectal cancer among Bulgarian patients.		PURPOSE: Variation in genetic factors together with xenobiotic exposure may result in increased risk of colorectal cancer. The P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is highly expressed in the apical membrane of enterocytes, where it pumps xenobiotics from the enterocytes back into the intestinal lumen. Thus, polymorphisms that reduce the activity of the MDR1 (ABCB1) efflux pump are potential risk factors for colorectal carcinogenesis. The aim of the present study is to genotype the MDR1 2677G&gt;T (rs2032582) and 3435C&gt;T (rs1045642) polymorphism in patients with colorectal cancer and controls and to identify a possible association between individual genetic variation and susceptibility to colorectal cancer. METHODS: In the present study, 146 Bulgarian patients with sporadic colorectal cancer and 160 healthy Bulgarian volunteers were evaluated for the two polymorphisms in MDR1. Polymorphisms were identified using rapid-cycle real-time amplification with allele-specific probes and subsequent melting curve analyses on a LightCyclertrade mark (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). RESULTS: No differences were found between the frequencies of the two mutant alleles in the tumor tissue from the cases and lymphocytes from the controls [frequencies of 2677T: 43.5% in patients and 44.1% in controls; frequencies of 3435T: 48.3% in patients and 50.9% in controls (both P &gt; 0.05)]. The MDR1 polymorphic sequence of the tumor tissue always matched that of normal intestinal tissue from the same patient. Consequently, genotyping of DNA from archived tumor tissues is a valid alternative to the use of leukocyte DNA. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that MDR1 2677G&gt;T and 3435C&gt;T polymorphism is not a risk factor for sporadic colon cancer among Bulgarians and that somatic mutation at these sites is not involved in the genesis of colon tumors. Further examination using larger number of samples must be necessary to reach to more reliable conclusions.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="36" length="7"></location><text>2677G&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="48" length="7"></location><text>3435C&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2032582</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1045642</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17566096</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of prostaglandin E synthase 2 (PTGES2) Arg298His polymorphism with type 2 diabetes in two German study populations.		CONTEXT: On the basis of its chromosomal localization and its role in the synthesis of the antilipolytic compound prostaglandin E(2), the prostaglandin E synthase 2 (PTGES2) is a candidate gene for type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether genetic variants in the PTGES2 gene are associated with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Sequencing of the PTGES2 gene revealed one nonsynonymous coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (Arg298His, rs13283456) and a previously unknown promoter SNP g.-417G&gt;T. Both SNPs and additional haplotype tagging SNPs (rs884115, rs10987883, rs4837240) were genotyped in a nested case-control study of 192 incident type 2 diabetes subjects and 384 controls (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam). Carriers of the minor allele of Arg298His had a lower risk to develop the disease [odds ratio (OR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.97, P = 0.04], compared with homozygous individuals with the common allele. The PTGES2 Arg298His polymorphism was reinvestigated in a population-based cross-sectional study (Cooperative Health Research in the Augsburg Region) consisting of 239 individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, 226 with type 2 diabetes, and 863 normoglycemic controls. In this study population, the Arg298His polymorphism was significantly associated with impaired glucose tolerance (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50-0.93, P = 0.007) and type 2 diabetes (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.43-0.86, P = 0.004). A pooled analysis of data from both study populations revealed reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.47-0.81, P = 0.0005) in PTGES2 298His allele carriers. CONCLUSION: We obtained evidence from two Caucasian study populations that the His298-allele of PTGES2 Arg298His confers to reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="51" length="9"></location><text>Arg298His</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs13283456</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17898129</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Interleukin-6 receptor gene variations, plasma interleukin-6 levels, and type 2 diabetes in U.S. Women.		OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between common variations in the IL6R gene and circulating interleukin (IL)-6 levels and diabetes risk. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined 10 linkage disequilibrium (LD)-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (SNP1 to SNP10) for the IL6R gene in a nested case-control study of 672 diabetic and 1,058 healthy European Caucasian women (IL-6 levels were measured in a subgroup of 1,348 women). RESULTS: In both control and diabetic patients, polymorphisms within an LD block spanning approximately 42 kb were significantly associated with plasma IL-6 levels. A missense variant SNP7 in exon 9 (rs8192284, Asp358Ala) showed the strongest association (P = 0.0005 in control and P = 0.004 in case subjects). The corresponding false-discovery rates, which accounts for multiple testing, were 0.008 and 0.02, respectively. We inferred five common haplotypes to capture 94% allele variance of the LD block using SNP5, -7, -8, -9, and -10. Compared with the most common haplotype 12111 (one codes the common and two codes the minor alleles), haplotypes 11211 [difference in log(IL-6) = -0.11 (95% CI -0.23 to -0.01); P = 0.01] and 21122 (-0.15 [-0.27 to -0.03]; P = 0.01) were associated with significantly lower IL-6 levels (global test, P = 0.01). However, IL6R genotypes were not significantly associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: IL6R genetic variations, especially SNP7 (rs8192284, Asp358Ala), were significantly associated with plasma IL-6 levels but not with diabetes risk in women. The strong associations between IL6R genetic variability and IL-6 concentrations deserve further investigation.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="762" length="9"></location><text>Asp358Ala</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2228145</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16945136</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Gene x Gene interaction between MnSOD and GPX-1 and breast cancer risk: a nested case-control study.		BACKGROUND: Germ-line mutations in genes such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM can cause a substantial increase in risk of breast cancer. However, these mutations are rare in the general population, and account for little of the incidence of sporadic breast cancer in the general population. Therefore, research has been focused on examining associations between common polymorphisms and breast cancer risk. To date, few associations have been described. This has led to the hypothesis that breast cancer is a complex disease, whereby a constellation of very low penetrance alleles need to be carried to present a risk phenotype. Polymorphisms in the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX-1) genes have been proposed as low penetrance alleles, and have not been clearly associated with breast cancer. We investigated whether variants at both polymorphisms, while not independently associated with breast cancer risk, could influence breast cancer risk when considered together. METHODS: A case-control study nested within the Nurses' Health Study was performed comparing 1262 women diagnosed with breast cancer to 1533 disease free women. The MnSOD (Val16Ala, rs1799725) and GPX-1 (Pro198Leu, rs1050450) were genotyped via TaqMan assay. Disease risk was evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS: While neither allele alone shows any change in breast cancer risk, an increase in the risk of breast cancer (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.09 - 3.19) is observed in individuals who carry both the Ala16Ala genotype of MnSOD and the Leu198Leu genotype of GPX-1. CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms in the GPX-1 and MnSOD genes are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1309" length="9"></location><text>Pro198Leu</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1277" length="8"></location><text>Val16Ala</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1050450</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4880</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17591627</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Complement factor H and hemicentin-1 in age-related macular degeneration and renal phenotypes.		In this study, we investigated the associations of complement factor H (CFH) and hemicentin-1 (HMCN1) with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and renal function. Three scales, measuring the course of AMD and drusen development, were examined in two samples: the Family Age-Related Macular degeneration Study (FARMS), consisting of families ascertained through a single individual with severe AMD, and an unascertained population-based family cohort, the Beaver Dam Eye Study (BDES), which was also used to assess longitudinal changes in AMD and associations with renal function. Associations were performed by a regression accounting for known risk factors as well as familial and sibling effects. Strong evidence of the association of rs1061170 (Y402H) variation with AMD was confirmed (P = 9.15 x 10(-5) in BDES, P = 0.016 in FARMS). This association was observed in multiple AMD scales, suggesting that its role is not phenotype-specific. Polymorphisms in both CFH and HMCN1 appeared to influence the longitudinal rate of change of AMD. The rs1061170 polymorphism was also associated with a reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (P = 0.046). Another CFH polymorphism, rs800292, was similarly associated with eGFR [beta = -0.90 (P = 0.022)]. Associations between rs743137 (P = 0.05) and rs680638 (P = 0.022) in HMCN1 with calculated creatinine clearance progression were also observed. Both genes appear to play a role in both AMD and renal pathophysiology. These findings support evidence for common pathways influencing ocular and renal function and suggest that further work is required on their common determinants.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="847" length="5"></location><text>Y402H</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1061170</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17873324</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>The G1422A variant of the cannabinoid receptor gene (CNR1) is associated with abdominal adiposity in obese men.		Since recent data suggest that the endocannabinoid system controls food intake through central, and lipogenesis via peripheral CB1 receptors, we hypothesized that genetic variation at the cannabinoid receptor-1 (CNR1) locus could have an effect on adiposity. We investigated, whether a specific CNR1 G1422A genotype is associated with anthropometric markers of obesity and fat distribution in adult obese individuals. A total of 1,064 obese subjects (BMI &gt; or = 30 kg/m2) without diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance or other endocrine diseases and 251 healthy control persons were genotyped for the G1422A variant (rs1049353) with a TaqMan assay. Anthropometric measures as body weight, BMI, waist and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were assessed by classical methods. Fat mass (FM) was measured by bio-impedance. The prevalence of the G1422A variant was not significantly different between cases and controls (OR = 1.056; P = 0.626). In obese women, no meaningful associations between CNR1 genotype and anthropometric parameters were found. In obese men, CNR1 1422 A/A genotype was significantly associated with higher WHR (P = 0.009) and waist circumference (P = 0.008) after adjusting for age and BMI. Fat mass percentage showed an association (P = 0.011) which disappeared after adjusting for age and BMI. A trend for an association was seen for fat mass (unadjusted P = 0.099; adjusted P = 0.033).

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Plasma cell membrane glycoprotein 1 (PC-1) inhibits insulin signalling by direct interaction with the insulin receptor alpha subunit. This inhibition is enhanced by the minor Q allele of the K121Q polymorphism (rs1044498) in the gene (ENPP1) encoding PC-1. This polymorphism has been studied in relation to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and obesity in several populations with conflicting results. We assessed the impact of the ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism on type 2 diabetes, obesity and quantitative metabolic traits in 7,333 Danes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The K121Q polymorphism was genotyped in the population-based Inter99 study cohort (5,961 subjects) and in a group of 1,386 patients with type 2 diabetes. All subjects were Danish whites. RESULTS: No significant associations with type 2 diabetes or related quantitative metabolic traits, including measures of insulin resistance, were detected. However, a meta-analysis of the present and published studies revealed an association with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio per Q allele, 1.17 [95% CI 1.10-1.25], p=1x10(-6)). In case-control studies comparing subjects of different BMI strata, we observed a putative association of the codon 121 QQ genotype with being overweight (BMI&gt;25 kg/m(2); odds ratio 1.63 [95% CI 1.09-2.46], p=0.015), an association not observed when comparing other levels of BMI or when analysing BMI as a quantitative trait. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In a meta-analysis, the ENPP1 codon 121 Q allele associates with type 2 diabetes. However, a similar association was not found in the present study of Danish white subjects. The effect of this variant on obesity in Danish subjects is contentious and further study is needed.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="46" length="5"></location><text>K121Q</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1044498</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18028454</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Myocardin gene regulatory variants as surrogate markers of cardiac hypertrophy - study in a genetically homogeneous population.		Myocardin is thought to contribute to heart hypertrophy as assessed in animal models. The aim of this study was to identify polymorphisms on the myocardin gene and investigate possible relationships with left ventricular structure in human hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Eighty-four native Cretan individuals (36 patients with HCM and 48 healthy controls) were examined by direct sequencing and subsequent restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and six polymorphisms were identified in the promoter region at positions -435T&gt;C (rs758187), -629A&gt;T (rs8071072), -1030C&gt;G (rs1233851), -1069A&gt;G, -1166A&gt;G and -1406G&gt;A (rs976906). Allele and haplotype frequencies were not significantly different between patients and controls. However, patients carrying the [-435C;-629T] allelic variant had decreased left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT, p = 0.020) and left ventricular mass (p = 0.006) as compared with the wild-type genotype. Carrier status of this myocardin promoter allelic variant was also associated with significant lower myocardin mRNA levels in peripheral blood (p = 0.039). Thus, a myocardin promoter allelic variant existing in the normal Cretan population was associated with decreased left ventricular mass in HCM patients and decreased myocardin mRNA levels in peripheral blood. Our results may be limited by the limited sample size, but are strengthened by the genetic homogeneity of the Cretan population. Our data suggest that functional natural myocardin promoter variation might be a genetic factor contributing to inter-individual differences in the development of cardiac hypertrophy.</text><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="683" length="7"></location><text>-629A&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="704" length="8"></location><text>-1030C&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="663" length="7"></location><text>-435T&gt;C</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="749" length="8"></location><text>-1406G&gt;A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1233851</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs976906</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs8071072</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs758187</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18316360</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>AHSG tag single nucleotide polymorphisms associate with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia: studies of metabolic traits in 7,683 white Danish subjects.		OBJECTIVE: The gene encoding the alpha2 Heremans-Schmid glycoprotein (AHSG) is a credible biological and positional candidate gene for type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, and previous attempts to relate AHSG variation with type 2 diabetes and obesity in Swedish and French Caucasians have been largely successful. We related seven frequent AHSG tag single nucleotide polymorphisms to a range of metabolic traits, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The polymorphisms were genotyped in 7,683 white Danish subjects using Taqman allelic discrimination or chip-based matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, providing a statistical power of &gt;99% to replicate previous findings. Data were analyzed in case-control and haplotype settings, and quantitative metabolic traits were examined for association. Moreover, epistatic effects between AHSG variants and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) and beta-2-adrenergic receptor polymorphisms were investigated. RESULTS: The -469T&gt;G (rs2077119) and IVS6+98C&gt;T (rs2518136) polymorphisms were associated with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.007 and P = 0.006, respectively, or P(corr) = 0.04 and P(corr) = 0.03, respectively, following correction for multiple hypothesis testing), and in a combined analysis of the present and a previous study -469T&gt;G remained significant (odds ratio 0.90 [95% CI 0.84-0.97]; P = 0.007). Furthermore, two AHSG haplotypes were associated with dyslipidemia (P = 0.003 and P(corr) = 0.009). Thr248Met (rs4917) tended to associate with lower fasting and post-oral glucose tolerance test serum insulin release (P = 0.02, P(corr) = 0.1 for fasting and P = 0.04, P(corr) = 0.2 for area under the insulin curve) and improved insulin sensitivity estimated by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (9.0 vs. 8.6 mmol x l(-1) x pmol(-1) x l(-1); P = 0.01, P(corr) = 0.06). Indications of epistatic effects of AHSG variants with the IRS1 Gly971Arg polymorphism were observed for fasting serum triglyceride concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Based on present and previous findings, common variation in AHSG may contribute to the interindividual variation in metabolic traits.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1208" length="7"></location><text>-469T&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1694" length="9"></location><text>Thr248Met</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1232" length="10"></location><text>IVS6+98C&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2077119</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2518136</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4917</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17187763</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of PGC-1alpha variants Gly482Ser and Thr612Met concerning their PPARgamma2-coactivation function.		Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) is a cofactor involved in adaptive thermogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and gluconeogenesis. Dysfunctions of this protein are likely to contribute to the development of obesity and the metabolic syndrome. This is in part but not definitely confirmed by results of population studies. The aim of this study was to investigate if common genetic variants rs8192678 (Gly482Ser) and rs3736265 (Thr612Met) in the PGC-1alpha gene lead to a functional consequence in cofactor activity using peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma 2 (PPARgamma2) as interacting transcription factor. Reporter gene assays in HepG2 cells with wildtype and mutant proteins of both PGC1alpha and PPARgamma2 (Pro12Ala, rs1801282) using the acyl-CoA-binding protein (ACBP) promoter showed no difference in coactivator activity. This is the first study implicating that the Gly482Ser and Thr612Met polymorphisms in PGC-1alpha and Pro12Ala polymorphism in PPARgamma2 do not affect the functional integrity of these proteins.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="32" length="9"></location><text>Gly482Ser</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="46" length="9"></location><text>Thr612Met</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="877" length="8"></location><text>Pro12Ala</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs8192678</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1801282</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3736265</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16483362</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>The quantification of COMT mRNA in post mortem cerebellum tissue: diagnosis, genotype, methylation and expression.		BACKGROUND: The COMT gene is located on chromosome 22q11, a region strongly implicated in the aetiology of several psychiatric disorders, in particular schizophrenia. Previous research has suggested that activity and expression of COMT is altered in schizophrenia, and is mediated by one or more polymorphisms within the gene, including the functional Val158Met polymorphism. METHOD: In this study we examined the expression levels of COMT mRNA using quantitative RT-PCR in 60 post mortem cerebellum samples derived from individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and no history of psychopathology. Furthermore, we have examined the methylation status of two CpG sites in the promoter region of the gene. RESULTS: We found no evidence of altered COMT expression or methylation in any of the psychiatric diagnoses examined. We did, however, find evidence to suggest that genotype is related to COMT gene expression, replicating the findings of two previous studies. Specifically, val158met (rs165688; Val allele) rs737865 (G allele) and rs165599 (G allele) all showed reduced expression (P &lt; 0.05). Finally, we observe a strong sexual dimorphism in COMT expression, with females exhibiting significantly greater levels of COMT mRNA. CONCLUSION: The expression of COMT does not appear to be altered in the cerebellum of individuals suffering from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or depression, but does appear to be influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms within the gene.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="468" length="9"></location><text>Val158Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4680</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16713673</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Variations in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma gene and melanoma risk.		There is strong evidence to suggest that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcriptional regulators, mediates tumor suppressive activities in a variety of human cancers. Recently, PPARgamma agonists were found to inhibit growth of melanoma cell lines. Here, we tested the possibility that variations in the gene encoding PPARgamma (PPARG) influence melanoma risk. Two variations of PPARG (P12A[rs1801282] and C161T [rs3856806]) were investigated in two independent case-control studies with a total of 832 melanoma patients and 790 control individuals. In the first study, homozygous carriers of the rare *T allele of the C161T polymorphism in exon 6 of PPARG were significantly more common among patients with melanoma than among healthy subjects (6.0 vs. 2.0%; P=0.0096) and this association was independent of clinical risk factors such as skin type and nevus count (odds ratio 5.18; 95% confidence interval 1.68-15.96; P=0.0041). This finding, however, could not be replicated in the second case-control study. We therefore conclude that the investigated PPARG polymorphisms are not likely to constitute a significant risk factor for the development of melanoma among German Caucasians.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="573" length="5"></location><text>C161T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="553" length="4"></location><text>P12A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3856806</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1801282</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16497333</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>No association between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and mood status in a non-clinical community sample of 7389 older adults.

INTRODUCTION: Thrombin-induced conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin plays an essential role in hemostasis and results in the stabilization of thrombi. Elevated plasma fibrinogen levels have been associated with both increased plasma viscosity and platelet aggregability. Recently, a haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphism characterized by a C to T substitution at nucleotide 10034 of the fibrinogen gamma gene (FGG 10034C&gt;T, rs2066865), has been proposed as a novel risk factor for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Aim of the present study was to provide further data on the role of the FGG 10034C&gt;T polymorphism for DVT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FGG genotypes were determined by 5'-exonuclease assay (TaqMan) in 358 patients with documented DVT and a total of 783 control subjects. RESULTS: In a multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, presence of factor V Leiden and carriage of prothrombin 20210A, homozygosity for the FGG 10034 TT genotype yielded an odds ratio of 2.01 (95% CI 1.23-3.31; p=0.006) for DVT.

BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: A genome-wide association scan of nonsynonymous DNA polymorphisms identified association of a threonine-to-alanine substitution (T300A) in the autophagy-related 16-like gene ATG16L1 with Crohn's disease. We investigated this association in independent U.K. cohorts of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. METHODS: The T300A variant (rs2241880) was genotyped in an independent sample of 727 Crohn's disease and 877 ulcerative colitis cases, and in 579 controls. We then performed an extension analysis combining these data with the U.K. data from the initial study to give a total of 1236 U.K. Crohn's disease cases and 1235 controls to estimate disease risk and test for interaction with the CARD15 and IBD5 risk loci and for association with disease subtypes. RESULTS: The association of T300A was replicated in the independent sample of 727 Crohn's disease cases (P = .001), and was strongly associated in the extended analysis of 1236 Crohn's cases (P = 2.4 x 10(-6)). The 300A/A genotype conferred a 1.65-fold risk of Crohn's disease, with a 2.2-fold risk of ileal disease. Analysis of the interaction of ATG16L1 with CARD15 and IBD5 indicated that all 3 loci contribute independently to disease risk. Homozygosity for the risk allele at all 3 loci conferred a combined risk of 20.4 (95% confidence interval: 8.71, 47.7) for Crohn's disease. The ATG16L1 risk genotype showed a modest but significant association with ulcerative colitis (P = .026). CONCLUSIONS: The association of ATG16L1 with Crohn's disease and possibly with ulcerative colitis supports a role for autophagy in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="256" length="5"></location><text>T300A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2241880</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15564288</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Polymorphisms in XPD and TP53 and mutation in human lung cancer.		The pattern of somatic mutations in TP53 is distinct for particular cancers and carcinogenic exposures, providing clues to disease etiology, e.g. G:C--&gt;T:A mutations in TP53 are more frequently observed in smoking-associated lung cancers. In order to investigate possible causes and mechanisms of lung cancer susceptibility differences, the TP53 gene was sequenced in a case-only study of lung cancers (206 men and 103 women). Our primary hypothesis was that the TP53 mutation spectrum is influenced by polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA repair and apoptosis. We observed a TP53 mutation frequency in exons 5-8 of 25%. Functional polymorphisms in XPD (Asp312Asn, rs1799793 and Lys751Gln, rs1052559), a protein required for nucleotide excision repair and with roles in p53-mediated apoptosis, were modestly associated with G:C--&gt;T:A mutations in TP53 in lung tumors [Asp/Asn312 + Asn/Asn312 and/or Lys/Gln751 + Gln/Gln751 versus Asp/Asp312 + Lys/Lys751; odds ratio (OR) 2.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-7.61], consistent with the role of this protein in repair of bulky carcinogen-DNA adducts. In addition, a TP53 polymorphism (Arg72Pro, rs1042522) with a known role in the efficiency of apoptosis was also associated with the presence of a TP53 mutation (Pro/Arg72 or Pro/Pro72 versus Arg/Arg72; OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.21-4.17) or a G:C--&gt;T:A mutation in TP53 (Pro/Arg72 or Pro/Pro72 versus Arg/Arg72; OR 2.42, 95% CI 0.97-6.04). An interaction between the XPD variant alleles (Asn312 and Gln751) and the TP53 Pro72 allele was observed for TP53 mutations (any TP53 mutation P(int) = 0.027, G:C--&gt;T:A TP53 mutation P(int) = 0.041). The statistical interaction observed in our study is consistent with the observed biological interaction for XPD and p53 in nucleotide excision repair and apoptosis. In conclusion, differences in TP53 mutation spectra in lung tumors are associated with several genetic factors and may reflect differences in lung cancer susceptibility and carcinogenesis.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1204" length="8"></location><text>Arg72Pro</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="747" length="9"></location><text>Lys751Gln</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="722" length="9"></location><text>Asp312Asn</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1042522</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1799793</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs13181</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15345705</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Sequence variants of the gene encoding chemoattractant receptor expressed on Th2 cells (CRTH2) are associated with asthma and differentially influence mRNA stability.		The gene, CRTH2, encoding a receptor for prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)), is located within the peak linkage region for asthma on chromosome (Chr.) 11q reported in African American families. Family-based analysis of asthma and two common SNPs [G1544C and G1651A (rs545659)] in the 3'-untranslated region of CRTH2 showed significant evidence of linkage in the presence of disequilibrium for the 1651G allele (P = 0.003) of SNP rs545659. Haplotype analysis yielded additional evidence of linkage disequilibrium for the 1544G-1651G haplotype (P &lt; 0.001). Population-based case-control analyses were conducted in two independent populations, and demonstrated significant association of the 1544G-1651G haplotype with asthma in an African American population (P = 0.004), and in a population of Chinese children (P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, in the Chinese children the frequency of the 1651G allele in near-fatal asthmatics was significantly higher than mild-to-moderate asthmatics (P = 0.001) and normal controls (P &lt; 0.001). The 1651G allele of SNP re545659 was also associated with a higher degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (P &lt; 0.027). Transcriptional pulsing experiments showed that the 1544G-1651G haplotype confers a significantly higher level of reporter mRNA stability, when compared with a non-transmitted haplotype (1544C-1651A), suggesting that the CRTH2 gene on Chr. 11q is a strong candidate gene for asthma.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="419" length="6"></location><text>G1651A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs545659</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17704904</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>ENPP1 K121Q polymorphism and obesity, hyperglycaemia and type 2 diabetes in the prospective DESIR Study.		AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We assessed the predictive value of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 gene (ENPP1) SNPs with regard to the risk of developing obesity and/or type 2 diabetes in a large French general population. METHODS: We genotyped the ENPP1 SNPs K121Q (rs1044498), IVS20delT-11 (rs1799774) and A/G+1044TGA (rs7754561) in 5,153 middle-aged participants of the Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance Syndrome (DESIR) cohort. RESULTS: At baseline, the K121Q polymorphism was not associated either with BMI (p = 0.98) or with class I obesity (odds ratio [OR] 0.99, p = 0.81), but showed a borderline association with class II obesity (OR 1.65, p = 0.02). The K121Q variant was not associated with any trait during the 9-year follow-up. Pooled analyses both at baseline and at follow-up failed to show any association with hyperglycaemia (OR 1.08, p = 0.28) or type 2 diabetes (OR 1.15, p = 0.38). However, we did show an association of the Q121 allele with the risk of hyperglycaemia (OR 1.45, p = 0.001; n = 265) and type 2 diabetes (OR 1.65, p = 0.01; n = 103) in participants reporting a family history of type 2 diabetes. These results did not remain significant after a Bonferroni correction. The IVS20delT-11 and A/G+1044TGA polymorphisms and the three-allele risk haplotype (K121Q, IVS20delT-11 and A--&gt;G+1044TGA [QdelTG]) were not associated with any trait, either at baseline or at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In a general French population we did not find an association of the QdelTG risk haplotype with adult obesity and type 2 diabetes. We detected nominal evidence of association between the K121Q polymorphism and both severe adult obesity at baseline and the risk of hyperglycaemia or type 2 diabetes in participants with a family history of type 2 diabetes in pooled analyses both at baseline and follow-up.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="6" length="5"></location><text>K121Q</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1044498</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17632285</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>The brain-derived neurotrophic factor rs6265 (Val66Met) polymorphism and depression in Mexican-Americans.

Advances in genomics offer new strategies for assessing the association of common genetic variations at multiple loci and risk of many diseases, including colorectal cancer. Low-penetrance alleles of genes in many biological pathways, such as DNA repair, metabolism, inflammation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and Wnt signaling, may influence the risk of nonfamilial colorectal cancer. To identify susceptibility genes for colorectal cancer, we designed a large-scale case-control association study nested within the Nurses' Health Study (190 cases and 190 controls) and the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study (168 cases and 168 controls). We used a custom GoldenGate (Illumina) oligonucleotide pool assay including 1,536 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) selected in candidate genes from cancer-related pathways, which have been sequenced and genotyped in the SNP500Cancer project; 1,412 of the 1,536 (92%) of the SNPs were genotyped successfully within 388 genes. SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (r(2) &gt;/= 0.90) with another assayed SNP were excluded from further analyses. As expected by chance (and not significant compared with a corrected Bonferroni P = 0.00004), in the additive model, 11 of 1,253 (0.9%) SNPs had a P(trend) &lt; 0.01 and 38 of 1,253 (3.0%) SNPs had a P(trend) &gt;/= 0.01 and P(trend) &lt; 0.05. Of note, the MGMT Lys(178)Arg (rs2308237) SNP, in linkage disequilibrium with the previously reported MGMT Ile(143)Val SNP, had an inverse association with colorectal cancer risk (MGMT Lys(178)Arg: odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.78; unadjusted P(trend) = 0.0003 for the additive model; gene-based test global P = 0.00003). The SNP500Cancer database and the Illumina GoldenGate Assay allowed us to test a larger number of SNPs than previously possible.

This study was to examine the correlations of polymorphisms in nucleotide excision repair system to sensitivity of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to platinum-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Treatment outcomes of 200 advanced NSCLC patients, treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, were evaluated. XPC-PAT, XPD Lys751Gln (rs1052559), and ERCC1 C8092A (rs1052559) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment length polymorphism (PCR-AFLP) or PCR-restrictive fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) methods in the 200 patients. Unconditional logistic regression model was used to analyze the correlation of genetic polymorphisms to clinical response. RESULTS: The distributions of XPC-PAT genotypes differed significantly between response group (complete response + partial response) and un-response group (stable disease + progressive disease)(P=0.023). The XPC LL genotype carriers had higher response rate than the SS genotype carriers (OR=3.04; 95% CI=1.25-7.41, P= 0.015). The XPD Lys751Gln and ERCC1 C8092A polymorphisms were not found to be associated with platinum-based chemotherapy. However, these 3 genetic polymorphisms in nucleotide excision repair system had interaction in the drug sensitivity (P=0.021). CONCLUSION: The genetic polymorphisms of XPC-PAT, XPD Lys751Gln, and ERCC1 C8092A in nucleotide excision repair system may be associated with sensitivity of NSCLC patients to platinum-based chemotherapy.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="643" length="6"></location><text>C8092A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="610" length="9"></location><text>Lys751Gln</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs13181</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs13181</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17146660</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of MDR1 genotypes with susceptibility to colorectal cancer in older non-smokers.		OBJECTIVE: The multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) seems to play a role in the carcinogenesis of colorectal tumors. The importance of MDR1 SNPs 2677G &gt; T/A in exon 21 and 3435C &gt; T in exon 26 for cancer susceptibility, however, has not yet been clearly defined. METHODS: Two hundred and eighty-five colorectal cancer patients and 275 controls from five hospitals in the European part of Russia were genotyped for the polymorphisms -129T &gt; C (rs3213619) in exon 1b, 2677G &gt; T/A (rs2032582), and 3435C &gt; T (rs1045642) in this population-based case-control study. Genotype-phenotype analysis was performed with simultaneous consideration of lifestyle risk factors. RESULTS: Our analysis confirmed the preponderate impact of smoking on colorectal cancer development. The risk of heavy smokers (&gt;/=60 pack years) to develop colorectal cancer by far exceeded that of lifelong non-smokers (OR = 3.9, 95% CI: 1.4 to 10.6). Smoking is a more potent risk factor than is the genetic influence of MDR1 in our study. However, a smoking and age-stratified analysis, revealed a statistically significant association between MDR1 genotypes and colorectal cancer in life-long non-smokers with an age &gt; or =63 years (the median age in our sample). The association was stronger for rectal cancer than for colon cancer. Patients who carried the genotypes (-129TT; 2677GG; 3435CC) or (-129TT; 2677TT; 3435TT) developed more frequently colorectal cancer than others (OR = 3.9; 95% CI: 2.0 to 7.7). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the interaction of genetic and lifestyle risk factors should be taken into account to elucidate the genetic influence of MDR1 variability on cancer susceptibility.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="524" length="9"></location><text>-129T &gt; C</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="264" length="9"></location><text>3435C &gt; T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="237" length="9"></location><text>2677G &gt; T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3213619</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2032582</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1045642</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16543247</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Polymorphisms in oxidative stress genes and risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.		Evidence supporting the contribution of oxidative stress to key pathways in cancer, such as inflammation and DNA damage, continues to mount. We investigated variations within genes mediating oxidative stress to determine whether they alter risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Thirteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 10 oxidative stress genes (AKR1A1, AKR1C1, CYBA, GPX, MPO, NOS2A, NOS3, OGG1, PPARG and SOD2) were genotyped in 1172 NHL cases and 982 population-based controls from a USA multicenter case-control study. For NHL and five subtypes (diffuse large B-cell, follicular, marginal zone, small lymphocytic and T-cell), SNP associations were calculated. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were adjusted for sex, age (&lt;45, 45-64, 65+ years), race (white, black, other) and study site. Overall, the oxidative stress pathway was associated significantly with the B-cell NHL subtype, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (global P-value=0.003). Specifically, for nitric oxide synthase (NOS2A Ser608Leu, rs2297518) Leu/Leu homozygotes, there was a 2-fold risk increase for NHL (OR=2.2, 95% CI=1.1-4.4) (referent=Ser/Ser and Ser/Leu). This risk increase was consistent by cell lineage (B- and T-cell NHL) and pronounced for the two most common subtypes, diffuse large B-cell (OR=3.4, 95% CI=1.5-7.8) and follicular lymphoma (OR=2.6, 95% CI=1.0-6.8). In an analysis of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2 Val16Ala, rs1799725) Ala/Ala homozygotes, we observed moderately increased risks for B-cell lymphomas (OR=1.3, 95% CI=1.0-1.6; referent=Val/Val and Val/Ala) that was consistent across the B-cell subtypes. Genetic variations that result in an increased generation of reactive oxygen species appear to increase risk for NHL and its major subtypes, particularly DLBCL. Independent replication of our findings are warranted and further evaluation of oxidative stress in the context of inflammation, DNA repair and the induction of the NF-kappaB pathway may further reveal important clues for lymphomagenesis.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1102" length="9"></location><text>Ser608Leu</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1513" length="8"></location><text>Val16Ala</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2297518</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4880</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17096334</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Ala394Thr polymorphism in the clock gene NPAS2: a circadian modifier for the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.		Circadian disruption is theorized to cause immune dysregulation, which is the only established risk factor for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Genes responsible for circadian rhythm are also involved in cancer-related biological pathways as potential tumor suppressors. However, no previous studies have examined associations between circadian genes and NHL risk. In this population-based case control study (n = 455 cases; 527 controls), we examined the only identified nonsynonymous polymorphism (Ala394Thr; rs2305160) in the largest circadian gene, neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2), in order to examine its impact on NHL risk. Our results demonstrate a robust association of the variant Thr genotypes (Ala/Thr and Thr/Thr) with reduced risk of NHL (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51-0.85, p = 0.001), especially B-cell lymphoma (OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.47-0.80, p &lt;or= 0.0001). These findings provide the first molecular epidemiologic evidence supporting a role of circadian genes in lymphomagenesis, which suggests that genetic variations in circadian genes might be a novel panel of promising biomarkers for NHL and warrants further investigation.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="607" length="9"></location><text>Ala394Thr</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2305160</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17173513</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>No association between variants in the ACE and angiotensin II receptor 1 genes and acute mountain sickness in Nepalese pilgrims to the Janai Purnima Festival at 4380 m.		Koehle, Michael S., Pei Wang, Jordan A. Guenette, and Jim L. Rupert. No association between variants in the ACE and angiotensin II receptor 1 genes and acute mountain sickness in Nepalese pilgrims to the Janai Purnima Festival at 4380 m. High Alt. Med. Biol. 7:281-289, 2006.--Acute mountain sickness (AMS) causes significant morbidity among visitors to altitude. The primary contributors to developing AMS are altitude and rate of ascent; however, the substantial variation in susceptibility between individuals has led a number of investigators to propose that there may be genetic predilection to the disease. The ACE I/D polymorphism has been shown to predict performance among elite mountaineers. This study compares genotype and allele frequencies at the ACE I/D locus, two other loci in the ACE gene, and one locus in the angiotensin-2 receptor gene between individuals who did, or did not, express signs of AMS while attending a high altitude religious festival in Nepal (4380 m). Subjects (80 males, 23 females) were recruited and genotyped. All subjects were Nepalese. Forty-four of the subjects had been diagnosed with AMS by physicians at a high altitude health camp; the rest were free from altitude illness. All subjects were genotyped at polymorphic loci in the genes encoding angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II receptor type 1 gene (AGTR1). The polymorphisms examined were two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACE (ACE(A-240T), dbSNP rs4291; and ACE(A2350G), dbSNP rs4343), the intronic Alu insertion in ACE (ACE I/D), and the SNP ATR(A1166C), (dbSNP rs17231380) in AGTR1d. All polymorphisms in ACE were found to be in linkage disequilibrium. No significant associations were found between AMS incidence and any of the alleles, suggesting that variants at these loci do not contribute to susceptibility to AMS in this population.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1750" length="6"></location><text>A1166C</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1634" length="6"></location><text>A-240T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1665" length="6"></location><text>A2350G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5186</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4343</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4291</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16266783</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of correlation between serum D-serine levels and functional promoter polymorphisms of GRIN2A and GRIN2B genes.		D-Serine is an endogenous coagonist that increases the opening of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor channels. We previously reported a reduction of D-serine serum levels in schizophrenia, supporting the disease hypothesis of NMDA receptor-mediated hypo-neurotransmission. The serum levels of D-serine are thought to reflect brain d-serine content. It is important to understand whether there is a direct link between the altered D-serine levels and NMDA receptor expression in vivo or whether these are independent processes. Two polymorphisms are known to regulate the expression of NMDA receptor subunit genes: (GT)(n) (rs3219790) in the promoter region of the NR2A subunit gene (GRIN2A) and -200T &gt; G (rs1019385) in the NR2B gene (GRIN2B). These polymorphisms are also reported to be associated with schizophrenia. Therefore, we examined the correlation between these two polymorphisms and d-serine serum levels in mentally healthy controls, schizophrenics and the combined group. We observed no significant genotype-phenotype correlations in any of the sample groups. However, analyses of larger sample numbers and the detection of additional polymorphisms that affect gene expression are needed before we can conclude that NMDA receptor expression and serum levels of d-serine, if involved in schizophrenia pathophysiology, are independent and additive events.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="833" length="9"></location><text>-200T &gt; G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1019385</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16614108</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of the progesterone receptor gene with breast cancer risk: a single-nucleotide polymorphism tagging approach.		Association studies on susceptibility to breast cancer using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the progesterone receptor (PGR) gene have been previously published, but the results have been inconclusive. We used a comprehensive SNP-tagging approach to search for low-penetrance susceptibility alleles in a study of up to 4,647 cases and 4,564 controls, in a two-stage study design. We identified seven tagging SNPs using genotype data from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Environmental Genome Project and typed these, and an additional three SNPs, in 2,345 breast cancer cases and 2,284 controls (set 1). Three SNPs showed no evidence for association and were not studied further, whereas seven SNPs (rs11571171, rs7116336, rs660149, rs10895068, rs500760, rs566351, and rs1042838) exhibited significant associations at P &lt; 0.1 using either a heterogeneity or trend test and progressed to be genotyped in set 2. After both stages, only one SNP was significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer - the PGR-12 (rs1042638) V660L valine to leucine polymorphism [VL heterozygotes (odds ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.24) and the LL homozygotes (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.73), P(het) = 0.008, P(trend) = 0.002]. Similar estimates were obtained in a combined analysis of our data with those from three other published studies. We conclude that the 660L allele may be associated with a moderately increased risk of breast cancer, but that other common SNPs in the PGR gene are unlikely to be associated with a substantial risk of breast cancer.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1199" length="5"></location><text>V660L</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1042838</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18075476</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>GPR50 is not associated with childhood-onset mood disorders in a large sample of Hungarian families.		We investigated the relationship of the gene for the X-linked orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPR50) to childhood-onset mood disorders in a sample of 384 families with 468 affected children and adolescents collected in Hungary. Our choice of this gene for study was based on a previous report of an association of GPR50 with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. A significant association with the deletion allele of an insertion/deletion polymorphism (Delta502-505) located in exon 2 had been reported in a sample of 226 patients with major depressive disorder and 264 patients with bipolar disorder. The association was more significant in females compared with males in those samples. We used for this study a polymorphism in complete linkage disequilibrium with the Delta502-505 polymorphism, Thr532Ala (rs561077), and two additional polymorphisms, Val606Ile (rs13440581) and an intronic polymorphism (rs2072621). We found no evidence for an association for the markers analyzed individually, nor for haplotypes of these markers. Further, we found no evidence of association when the results were analyzed in girls only (n=215).

Altered myocardial repolarization is one of the important substrates of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The influence of rare gene variants on repolarization is evident in familial long QT syndrome. To investigate the influence of common gene variants on the QT interval we performed a linkage disequilibrium based SNP association study of four candidate genes. Using a two-step design we analyzed 174 SNPs from the KCNQ1, KCNH2, KCNE1, and KCNE2 genes in 689 individuals from the population-based KORA study and 14 SNPs with results suggestive of association in a confirmatory sample of 3277 individuals from the same survey. We detected association to a gene variant in intron 1 of the KCNQ1 gene (rs757092, +1.7 ms/allele, P=0.0002) and observed weaker association to a variant upstream of the KCNE1 gene (rs727957, +1.2 ms/allele, P=0.0051). In addition we detected association to two SNPs in the KCNH2 gene, the previously described K897T variant (rs1805123, -1.9 ms/allele, P=0.0006) and a gene variant that tags a different haplotype in the same block (rs3815459, +1.7 ms/allele, P=0.0004). The analysis of additive effects by an allelic score explained a 10.5 ms difference in corrected QT interval length between extreme score groups and 0.951 of trait variance (P&lt;0.00005). These results confirm previous heritability studies indicating that repolarization is a complex trait with a significant heritable component and demonstrate that high-resolution SNP-mapping in large population samples can detect and fine map quantitative trait loci even if locus specific heritabilities are small.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1076" length="5"></location><text>K897T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1805123</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17333284</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic polymorphisms in transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1) and childhood asthma and atopy.		Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1) may influence asthma by modulating allergic airway inflammation and airway remodeling. The role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TGFB1 in asthma remains inconclusive. We examined TGFB1 SNPs in relation to asthma risk and degree of atopy among 546 case-parent triads, consisting of asthmatics aged 4-17 years and their parents in Mexico City. Atopy to 24 aeroallergens was determined by skin prick tests. We genotyped five TGFB1 SNPs, including two known functional SNPs [C-509T (rs1800469), T869C (rs1982073)] and three others (rs7258445, rs1800472, rs8179181), using TaqMan and Masscode assays. We analyzed the data using log-linear and polytomous logistic methods. Three associated SNPs, including the two known functional SNPs, were statistically significantly related to asthma risk. Individuals carrying the T allele of C-509T had an increased risk of asthma [relative risk (RR)=1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.08-1.87 for one copy; RR (95%CI)=1.95 (1.36-2.78) for two copies]. For T869C, the RRs (95%CI) were 1.47 (1.09-1.98) for one and 2.00 (1.38-2.90) for two copies of the C allele. Similar results were found for rs7258445. The haplotype containing all three risk alleles conferred an increased risk of asthma (RR=1.48, 95% CI=1.11-1.95 for one copy; RR=1.77, 95% CI=1.22-2.57 for two copies). These three SNPs were also related to the degree of atopy. This largest study to date of genetic variation in TGFB1 and asthma and atopy adds to increasing evidence for a role in these disorders.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="625" length="6"></location><text>C-509T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="645" length="5"></location><text>T869C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1800469</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1982073</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17417058</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Monoamine oxidase a gene is associated with borderline personality disorder.		OBJECTIVE: Monoamine oxidase A is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the degradation of certain neurotransmitter amines: serotonin and norepinephrine. As for its role in aggression, impulsivity, suicide and mood liability, monoamine oxidase A can be considered a functional candidate in borderline personality disorder. METHODS: To test for this hypothesis we genotyped two polymorphic markers in monoamine oxidase A gene, a promoter VNTR and an rs6323 (T941G) in exon 8, in 111 Caucasian borderline personality disorder patients and 289 Caucasian healthy controls. Association analyses using individual marker and haplotype data were performed by a program of COCAPHASE in UNPHASED (MRC Human Genome Mapping Project Resource Centre, Cambridge, UK). RESULTS: We found that the borderline personality disorder patients had a high frequency of the high activity VNTR alleles (chi=4.696, P=0.03) and a low frequency of the low activity haplotype (chi=5.089, P=0.02).

The tumor suppressor TP53 pathway plays a crucial role in preventing carcinogenesis through its ability to impose cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following DNA damage and oncogene activation. MDM2 is a key negative regulator of the TP53 pathway and is overexpressed in many cancers as oncoprotein. We investigated the association between genetic variation in the promoter region of MDM2 (c.-5+309G&gt;T, rs2279744:g.G&gt;T) and the coding region of TP53 (c.215G&gt;C, rs1042522:g.G&gt;C, designated Arg72Pro) and the risk of developing lung cancer. The genotypes of 1,106 patients and 1,420 controls were determined by tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR or PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Associations with risk of lung cancer were estimated by logistic regression. We observed an increased lung cancer risk associated with the MDM2 GG (odds ratio [OR] = 1.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.45-2.32) and TG (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.09-1.63) genotypes. An increased risk was also associated with the TP53 Pro/Pro genotype (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.17-1.85, P = 0.003) compared to the Arg/Arg genotype. The gene-gene interaction of MDM2 and TP53 polymorphisms increased lung cancer risk in a supermultiplicative manner (OR for the presence of both MDM2 GG and TP53 Pro/Pro genotypes = 4.56, 95% CI = 2.76-7.54). Significant interactions were observed between these polymorphisms (respectively and jointly) and smoking (OR = 10.41, 95% CI = 5.26-20.58) for smokers with both the MDM2 GG and TP53 Pro/Pro genotypes. In conclusion, genetic polymorphisms in cell cycle regulatory genes MDM2 and TP53 contribute to the risk of developing lung cancer.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="606" length="8"></location><text>Arg72Pro</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="507" length="11"></location><text>c.-5+309G&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="568" length="8"></location><text>c.215G&gt;C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1042522</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1042522</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2279744</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17214563</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic variations of the NR3A subunit of the NMDA receptor modulate prefrontal cerebral activity in humans.		INTRODUCTION: Recently, a novel N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunit, NR3A, has been discovered in the brain. This subunit decreases NMDA receptor activity by modulating the calcium permeability of the receptor channel and current density in cortical cells. Because the NR3A is expressed in the human prefrontal cortex, we hypothesized that genetic variations of the NR3A subunit modulate prefrontal activation. METHODS: Electromagnetic activity during selective attention (auditory oddball task with target processing) was measured in 281 healthy subjects. Genotyping of a missense variation (rs10989591, Val362Met) of the NR3A gene was performed. RESULTS: Individuals carrying Val/Val genotype showed significantly reduced frontal P300 amplitudes compared with Met/Met subjects. Subsequent low-resolution electromagnetic source analysis revealed that this group difference is likely caused by reduced activation in the inferior frontal gyrus. CONCLUSIONS: It was shown for the first time that the genetic constitution of the subunit composition of NMDA receptor regulation might be relevant for prefrontal information processing in humans. The results underline the pivotal role of glutamate in frontal lobe function and indicate that the NR3A subunit could be a plausible candidate gene for diseases with prefrontal dysfunctions.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="724" length="9"></location><text>Val362Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs10989591</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16741941</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Transmission distortion of BDNF variants to bipolar disorder type I patients from a South American population isolate.		Recent reports have implicated polymorphisms in the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene region in the etiology of several psychiatric phenotypes, including bipolar disorder. Significant disease association has been reported for the G allele at SNP rs6265, which encodes for Valine at position 66 of BDNF (Val66Met), an apparently functional variant of this key BDNF. Here we examined a sample of 224 bipolar type I patients and available parents (comprising a total of 212 nuclear families) ascertained in a South American population isolate (Antioquia, Colombia). We tested for transmission distortion to bipolar patients of alleles at the rs6265 polymorphism and at a microsatellite marker 1.3 kb away from this SNP. Significant excess transmission of the rs6265 G allele to cases was observed (chi(2) = 10.77, d.f. = 1, P = 0.001). Two-locus haplotype analysis showed a significant global transmission distortion (chi(2) = 16.059, d.f. = 7, P = 0.025) with an excess transmission of a haplotype comprising the rs6265 G allele and microsatellite allele 227. These results are consistent with previous studies pointing to a role for BDNF in susceptibility to mood disorders.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="435" length="8"></location><text>Val66Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6265</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18081002</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of catechol-O-methyltransferase variants with loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials.		OBJECTIVE: The loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) provides a measure of the central serotonergic activity. As dopamine transporter availabilities also correlate with LDAEP, a dopaminergic influence is probable. The enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is involved in the inactivation of synaptic dopamine. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between genetic variants of the COMT gene influencing synaptic dopamine levels and the LDAEP. METHODS: Rs737865 in intron 1, rs4680 coding for a Val158Met substitution and rs165599 in the 3' region were investigated in 95 carefully selected healthy subjects of German descent (41 males, 54 females). The LDAEP was calculated as a linear regression slope with stimulus intensity as independent and N1/P2-amplitude as dependent variables. RESULTS: Single marker analysis showed weak associations for two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs737865: CC vs. T allele carrier; rs4680: G-allele carrier vs. AA homozygotes). A-G (rs4680-rs165599) was associated with lower LDAEP scores. Accordingly, haplotype analysis with all SNPs (rs737865-rs4680-rs165599) showed that the T-A-G haplotype was associated with lower scores. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the hypothesis that the LDAEP is also influenced by dopaminergic transmission. However, replications of these very preliminary but potentially important findings in independent samples are needed.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="648" length="9"></location><text>Val158Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4680</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18068526</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of polymorphisms in the XIAP gene and analysis of association with lung cancer risk in a Korean population.		The X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is a potent mammalian IAP, and has been shown to play an important role in development and progression of cancer. Polymorphisms in the XIAP gene may influence XIAP production or activity, thereby modulating susceptibility to lung cancer. To test this hypothesis, we first screened for polymorphisms in the XIAP gene by direct sequencing of genomic DNA samples from 27 healthy Korean women and then performed a case-control study to evaluate the association between the polymorphisms and the risk of lung cancer. The XIAP genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification and melting curve analysis in 582 lung cancer patients and in 582 healthy control subjects who were frequency-matched for age and sex. We identified 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), one novel SNP [30051C&gt;G (A321G) in exon 3] and the following 11 known SNPs: 192G&gt;C (rs5956578), 262C&gt;T (rs28382699), 318C&gt;T (rs5958318), and 374C&gt;T (rs12687176) in the putative promoter; 26615A&gt;G (rs2355676) in intron 1; 41725A&gt;G (rs5958338) in intron 5; 42009A&gt;C (Q423P, rs5956583) in exon 6; 48162T&gt;C (rs17334739) and 48228C&gt;T (rs28382739) in intron 6; and 48542A&gt;G (rs28382740) and 49333G&gt;T (rs28382742) in 3'-UTR. Four of these 12 SNPs were selected for large-scale genotyping based on their frequencies and haplotype tagging status: 262C&gt;T, 318C&gt;T, 374C&gt;T, and 42009A&gt;C. The four XIAP polymorphisms and their haplotypes exhibited no apparent relationship with the risk of lung cancer. In addition, we observed no evidence of effect modification by age, sex, smoking history, or tumor histology. These results suggest that XIAP polymorphisms do not significantly affect susceptibility to lung cancer in Koreans.</text><annotation id="T6"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1178" length="8"></location><text>41725A&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T7"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1212" length="8"></location><text>42009A&gt;C</text></annotation><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1074" length="6"></location><text>318C&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T10"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1316" length="8"></location><text>48542A&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1098" length="6"></location><text>374C&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T11"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1342" length="8"></location><text>49333G&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T12"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1222" length="5"></location><text>Q423P</text></annotation><annotation id="T8"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1251" length="8"></location><text>48162T&gt;C</text></annotation><annotation id="T9"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1277" length="8"></location><text>48228C&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1033" length="6"></location><text>192G&gt;C</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1144" length="8"></location><text>26615A&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1053" length="6"></location><text>262C&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#11"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs28382742</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T11" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5956578</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#10"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs28382740</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T10" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs28382699</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#12"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5956583</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T12" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#9"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs28382739</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T9" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#8"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs17334739</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T8" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#7"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5956583</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T7" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#6"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5958338</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T6" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs12687176</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T5" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5958318</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2355676</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17852831</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genotyping of the reduced folate carrier-1 c.80G&gt;A polymorphism by pyrosequencing technology: importance of PCR and pre-PCR optimization.		When developing a genotyping assay by Pyrosequencing(trade mark) technology for the RFC1 (SLC19A1) c.80G&gt;A polymorphism (rs1051266), unequal peak heights in the pyrograms were observed, probably due to unequal amplification of the mutated and wild-type alleles. This rarely occurring problem could potentially render assignment of heterozygous genotypes uncertain. When the PCR conditions were studied, it was found that substitution of the dGTP nucleotide in the master mix by dGTP and dITP in proportion 1:1 largely overcame this problem. Heat denaturation of the DNA at 95 degrees C before PCR also counteracted the problem. A combination of these two modifications of the standard pyrosequencing PCR protocol gave the best results. We conclude that, with these modifications, the RFC1 c.80G&gt;A SNP can be reliably assayed by pyrosequencing.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="43" length="7"></location><text>c.80G&gt;A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1051266</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>14973783</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Melanocortin-4 receptor gene variant I103 is negatively associated with obesity.		Several rare mutations in the melanocortin-4 receptor gene (MC4R) predispose to obesity. For the most common missense variant V103I (rs2229616), however, the previously reported similar carrier frequencies in obese and nonobese individuals are in line with in vitro studies, which have not shown a functional implication of this variant. In the present study, we initially performed a transmission/disequilibrium test on 520 trios with obesity, and we observed a lower transmission rate of the I103 allele (P=.017), which was an unexpected finding. Therefore, we initiated two large case-control studies (N=2,334 and N=661) and combined the data with those from 12 published studies, for a total of 7,713 individuals. The resulting meta-analysis provides evidence for a negative association of the I103 allele with obesity (odds ratio 0.69; 95% confidence interval 0.50-0.96; P=.03), mainly comprising samples of European origin. Additional screening of four other ethnic groups showed comparable I103 carrier frequencies well below 10%. Genomic sequencing of the MC4R gene revealed three polymorphisms in the noncoding region that displayed strong linkage disequilibrium with V103I. In our functional in vitro assays, the variant was indistinguishable from the wild-type allele, as was the result in previous studies. This report on an SNP/haplotype that is negatively associated with obesity expands the successful application of meta-analysis of modest effects in common diseases to a variant with a carrier frequency well below 10%. The respective protective effect against obesity implies that variation in the MC4R gene entails both loss and gain of function.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="208" length="5"></location><text>V103I</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2229616</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17000047</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Serotonin 2A receptor gene is associated with personality traits, but not to disorder, in patients with borderline personality disorder.		Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a chronic, disabling, and high-risk mental disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of instability in regulation of emotion, interpersonal relationships, self-image, and impulse control beginning in early adulthood. BPD affects about 1%-2% of the general population and has a high mortality rate as a result of suicide and impulsive behaviour. The serotonin 2A receptor gene (HTR2A) is considered a candidate gene for BPD because multiple lines of evidence suggest that it plays an important role in suicide, impulsivity and emotional liability. To test for an association between HTR2A and BPD, we genotyped four polymorphisms, rs6313 (T102C), rs4941573, rs2296972 and rs6314 (His452Tyr), in 111 Caucasian patients with BPD and 287 Caucasian healthy controls. The program UNPHASED was used to compare allele and haplotype frequencies between cases and controls. We did not find a significant association between HTR2A and BPD based on allele, genotype or haplotype analyses. However, there were significant associations between HTR2A and personality traits in the BPD patients. The C allele of rs6313 and the A allele of rs4941573 associated with a higher Extraversion score. Our results suggest that the serotonin 2A receptor gene may not play a major role in the aetiology of borderline personality disorder, but may have a role in personality traits.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="862" length="9"></location><text>His452Tyr</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="821" length="5"></location><text>T102C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6314</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6313</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17901940</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association analysis of IL-12B and IL-23R polymorphisms in myocardial infarction.		The notion that coronary atherosclerosis and its most severe phenotype, myocardial infarction (MI), are chronic inflammatory diseases is supported by several lines of evidence. Interleukins (ILs) are important mediators and modulators of inflammation. Specific polymorphisms in the genes encoding subunits of IL-23 (IL-12B) and its receptor (IL-23R) have recently been consistently found to be associated with chronic immune-mediated diseases. In this study, we explored the hypothesis that these variants also affect the risk of MI. We conducted a case-control association study on a cohort of 738 British Caucasian MI patients and 716 population controls. We tested four variants (rs11209026, rs7517847, rs1343151, rs10889677) of IL-23R and the A1188C polymorphism (rs3212227) of IL-12B. There was no association of any IL-23R (rs11209026, p = 0.82; rs7517847, p = 0.87; rs1343151, p = 0.85; rs10889677, p = 0.48) or IL-12B (rs3212227, p = 0.32) polymorphisms with MI. Stratification for age, gender and other cardiovascular risk factors did not affect the findings. These results indicate that unlike other chronic inflammatory diseases, the examined variants are unlikely to be major contributors to the pathogenesis of MI.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="830" length="6"></location><text>A1188C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3212227</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16710702</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>No association between complement factor H gene polymorphism and exudative age-related macular degeneration in Japanese.		Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly population not only Western but also Asian industrial countries. In Caucasian, a polymorphism of the complement factor H gene (CFH), the C allele of rs1061170 (Y402H), was established as the first strong genetic factor for excursively exudative type of ARMD. In this study, we performed an extensive sequencing of the 22 exons in the CFH gene by recruiting 146 exudative ARMD patients and 105 normal controls of Japanese origin and identified 61 polymorphisms. We found that the frequency of the C allele of rs1061170 (Y402H) is much lower (0.04) in Japanese controls than in Caucasians (0.45). No case disease susceptibility to exudative ARMD was noted for rs1061170 (Y402H) (chi (2) = 3.19, P (corr) = 0.423), or other 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) whose frequency is greater than 0.05. When haplotypes were inferred for 13 SNPs (these 12 SNPs with a frequency greater than 0.05 and rs1061170), three haplotypes whose pattern was similar to those in Caucasians were identified but with substantial difference in frequency. Again we failed to identify genetic association between Japanese exudative ARMD and any of the haplotypes including the J1 haplotype which was shown to be susceptible to ARMD in Caucasians (chi (2 )=( )3.92, P (corr) = 0.157). CFH does not appear to be a primary hereditary contributor to ARMD in Japanese. The absence of CFH contribution to ARMD in Japanese may correlate with the findings in ethnic differences of ARMD phenotypes.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="371" length="5"></location><text>Y402H</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1061170</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18058054</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Polymorphisms in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) gene are associated with peak bone mass in non-sedentary men: results from the Odense androgen study.		PURPOSE: To investigate the impact of the Ala1330Val (rs3736228, exon 18) and Val667Met (rs4988321, exon 9) polymorphisms of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) gene on peak bone mass in young men. METHODS: The Odense Androgen Study (OAS) is a population-based study comprising 783 Caucasian men aged 20-30 years. Genotyping was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or fluorescence polarization. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements were performed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: The CC, CT, and TT genotypes in Ala1330Val were found in 75.6%, 21.8%, and 2.6% of the participants, respectively. Similarly, the GG, GA, and AA genotypes of Val667Met were found in 89.7%, 9.8%, and 0.5%, respectively. For the Ala1330Val polymorphism, no significant differences between the genotypes were found regarding BMD in the overall study population. However, when analysis was restricted to non-sedentary men (n = 589), a significant association between the number of T-alleles and BMD in the spine and whole body were found. Each copy of the T-allele changed the Z-score of the spine by (median and 95% confidence interval) -0.21 [95% CI: -0.40; -0.03] (p &lt; 0.02). Analysis suggested an association between the AA genotype in the Val667Met polymorphism and increased body height and decreased BMD of the femoral neck; however, no significant gene-dose effect of the A-allele could be demonstrated in the whole population. When the analysis was restricted to non-sedentary subjects, however, each number of A-alleles was associated with a change in Z-score of -0.26 [95% CI: -0.51; -0.01] (p = 0.04). No further significant results emerged with haplotype analysis. CONCLUSION: The Ala1330Val and Val667Met polymorphisms in the LRP5 gene are significantly associated with peak bone mass in physically active men.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="224" length="10"></location><text>Ala1330Val</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="260" length="9"></location><text>Val667Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3736228</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4988321</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16921495</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Possible role of preproghrelin gene polymorphisms in susceptibility to bulimia nervosa.		Previous investigations have suggested that ghrelin, an endogenous orexigenic peptide, is involved in the pathology of eating disorders. We conducted a study to determine whether any preproghrelin gene polymorphisms are associated with eating disorders. Three hundred thirty-six eating disorder patients, including 131 anorexia nervosa (AN)-restricting types (AN-R), 97 AN-binge eating/purging types (AN-BP) and 108 bulimia nervosa (BN)-purging types (BN-P), and 300 healthy control subjects participated in the study. Genotyping was performed to determine the polymorphisms present, and with this information, linkage disequilibrium (LD) between the markers was analyzed and the distributions of the genotypes, the allele frequencies, and the haplotype frequencies were compared between the groups. The Leu72Met (408 C &gt; A) (rs696217) polymorphism in exon 2 and the 3056 T &gt; C (rs2075356) polymorphism in intron 2 were in LD (D' = 0.902, r2 = 0.454). Both polymorphisms were significantly associated with BN-P (allele-wise: P = 0.0410, odds ratio (OR) = 1.48; P = 0.0035, OR = 1.63, for Leu72Met and 3056 T &gt; C, respectively). In addition, we observed a significant increase in the frequency of the haplotype Met72-3056C in BN-P patients (P = 0.0059, OR = 1.71). Our findings suggest that the Leu72Met (408 C &gt; A) and the 3056 T &gt; C polymorphisms of the preproghrelin gene are associated with susceptibility to BN-P.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="956" length="10"></location><text>3056 T &gt; C</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1383" length="8"></location><text>Leu72Met</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="903" length="9"></location><text>408 C &gt; A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2075356</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs696217</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs696217</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18035074</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of polymorphisms in platelet and hemostasis system genes with acute myocardial infarction.		BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms may affect the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis and thereby affect individual vulnerability to acute myocardial infarction (MI) among patients with underlying coronary atherosclerosis. METHODS: We enrolled 1375 patients with an initial clinical presentation of coronary disease. We genotyped 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 9 coagulation system genes and compared patients who had an initial acute MI with patients who presented with stable exertional angina. RESULTS: An SNP in CD36 (rs3211956) was significantly (P = .04) more common among patients who presented with acute MI (minor allele frequency 10.5%) than patients with stable exertional angina (minor allele frequency 8.0%). This association became marginally significant, however, after adjustment for conventional cardiac risk factors in an additive genetic model (odds ratio 1.34, CI 1.00-1.88, P = .053). An SNP in ITGB3 (Leu59Pro, rs5918) was slightly, but not significantly (P = .083), more common among patients with acute MI (minor allele frequency 14.5%) than among patients with stable exertional angina (minor allele frequency 12.0%). Two linked SNPs in THBD (Ala473Val, rs1042579; and rs3176123) were slightly, but not significantly (P = .079 and 0.052, respectively), less common among patients with acute MI (minor allele frequency 16.1%) than among patients with stable exertional angina (18.7% and 19.0%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Four SNPs in platelet glycoprotein and hemostatic genes were nominally associated with acute MI rather than stable exertional angina as the initial clinical presentation of coronary artery disease. These findings are suggestive but require independent confirmation in larger studies.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1294" length="9"></location><text>Ala473Val</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1049" length="8"></location><text>Leu59Pro</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1042579</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5918</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17656372</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Preservation of gray matter volume in multiple sclerosis patients with the Met allele of the rs6265 (Val66Met) SNP of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.		To investigate the association of the rs6265 (Val66Met) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with brain morphometry and functional status as measured by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neurocognitive testing in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. BDNF is released by neurons and by immune cells in MS brain. The rs6265 SNP variation of BDNF causes substitution of valine (Val) for methionine (Met) and interferes with activity-dependent BDNF secretion. A total of 209 treated MS patients (161 females; 48 males) underwent clinical brain MRI and were genotyped for the BDNF rs6265 Val66Met SNP. A subset of 108 patients had neurocognitive testing for processing speed, memory and executive function. The MRI measurements included T2 and T1-lesion volume (LV); normalized brain volume measures of whole brain (WB) volume, white and gray matter volume (NWMV and NGMV) and the diffusion-weighted imaging measure of WB mean parenchyma diffusivity (MPD). The Met66 allele status was positively associated with NGMV (P = 0.015, standardized beta = 0.15) and negatively associated with T2-LV (P = 0.041, standardized beta = -0.14). There were no significant associations between Met66 allele status and T1-LV, NWMV or MPD. On the Paced Serial Addition Test (PASAT), a trend (P = 0.057) favoring the Met66 allele group was observed. There were no significant associations between Met66 allele status and other neurocognitive measures. The BDNF Met66 allele is associated with lower damage as evidenced by measurement of NGMV and T2-LV in MS patients.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="101" length="8"></location><text>Val66Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6265</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16681991</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Prolylcarboxypeptidase gene, chronic hypertension, and risk of preeclampsia.		OBJECTIVE: Renin-angiotensin System is essential for the homeostasis of blood pressure in humans. The roles of renin-angiotensin system gene polymorphisms including angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme, renin and angiotensin II receptor, type 1 genes in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia have been extensively studied, but most association studies produced either negative or inconsistent results. Prolylcarboxypeptidase encodes a lysosomal enzyme and is a regulator for both renin-angiotensin system and the kallikrein-kinin system. There is no published study on prolylcarboxypeptidase gene and preeclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: We investigated the independent and joint association of five polymorphisms in angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and prolylcarboxypeptidase gene and chronic hypertension with the risk of preeclampsia in 125 preeclamptic and 1040 non-preeclamptic black women enrolled at the Boston Medical Center. We used logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratios of risk for preeclampsia associated with each gene polymorphism and its joint association with chronic hypertension. RESULTS: No association was found in four polymorphisms in angiotensinogen and angiotensin-converting enzyme. Prolylcarboxypeptidase E112D (rs2298668) D allele along and jointly with chronic hypertension were associated with a significantly increased risk of preeclampsia. Compared to women with homozygous EE genotype and without chronic hypertension, higher risks of preeclampsia were observed in DD women without chronic hypertension (OR = 3.7, 95% CI, 1.2 - 12.4) and EE women with chronic hypertension (OR = 9.1, 95% CI: 4.7 - 17.6). Women with both D allele and chronic hypertension had the highest risk (OR = 158, 95% CI, 25-infinite). This finding was validated in an independent sample of 1,015 non-black women. We further compared the prolylcarboxypeptidase transcript levels in peripheral blood cells of 23 preeclamptic (30% with chronic hypertension) and 51 non-preeclamptic (6% with chronic hypertension) women 2 - 3 days after delivery. The PRCP transcript levels were lower in ED/DD women than in EE woman (P = .03) and lower in preeclamptic women than in non-preeclamptic women (P = .007). CONCLUSION: Our data showed that prolylcarboxypeptidase D allele coupled with chronic hypertension was associated with a significantly increased risk of preeclampsia in both black and non-black women. Gene expression assays lent further support for the functional significance of prolylcarboxypeptidase in the etiology of preeclampsia.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1336" length="5"></location><text>E112D</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2298668</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17604842</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>No association between a TPH2 promoter polymorphism and mood disorders or monoamine turnover.		BACKGROUND: Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) is the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin synthesis. TPH2 is a recently discovered isoform that is expressed predominantly in serotonin neurons. Associations are reported of TPH2 polymorphisms with MDD, bipolar disorder and suicidal behavior. This study examines a single nucleotide polymorphism in the putative promoter region of the TPH2 gene. METHODS: One hundred nine bipolar, 324 major depressive disorder, and 130 healthy volunteers were genotyped for the rs4131347 (-C8347G) promoter SNP. Association was assessed with diagnosis, suicide attempt status, severity of psychopathology and cerebrospinal fluid monoamine metabolite levels of 5-HIAA, HVA, and MHPG. General linear models and logistic regression tested the effect of genotype*childhood abuse interactions on psychopathology severity and suicide attempt. RESULTS: There was no association between genotype and either mood disorder, suicide attempt status, psychopathology severity or CSF monoamine metabolite levels.

Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) plays a key role in remodeling triglyceride-rich particles and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). We investigated CETP sequence variants in response to long-term overfeeding (100 days) in 12 pairs of male monozygotic twins (mean age+/-S.D.: 21+/-2 years). Body fat mass (FM), abdominal subcutaneous (ASF) and visceral fat (AVF), and plasma lipoproteins were determined. The CETP variants C&gt;T/In9 (rs289714) and G&gt;A/Ex14 (rs5882, or I405V) were investigated by RFLP-PCR methodologies. Before overfeeding, the CETP CC/In9 (n=18) genotype was associated with lower FM compared to the C&gt;T/In9 heterozygotes. Overfeeding induced more FM and ASF accretion in C&gt;T/In9 carriers (P&lt;or=0.05). CETP V405V homozygotes (n=8) had lower BMI, FM, and ASF before overfeeding than those with the I405I (n=6) or I405V (n=10) genotypes. However, V405V subjects had the largest gain in AVF with overfeeding (P=0.02). Decreases from baseline were significantly different across the I405V genotypes for HDL-C, HDL-Apo AI, HDL(2), and HDL(3) (P&lt;or=0.05). Our data suggests that CETP sequence variation contributes to the undesirable changes in adiposity and HDL-C levels when exposed to excessive calorie consumption and may be potentially helpful to identify individuals with the metabolic syndrome who are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="582" length="5"></location><text>I405V</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5882</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16917932</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic evidence for ubiquitin-specific proteases USP24 and USP40 as candidate genes for late-onset Parkinson disease.		Linkage studies have defined susceptibility regions for late-onset Parkinson disease (PD) on chromosomes 1 and 2, but specific genetic variants have not been definitively identified. Here we report the results of a case-control study to identify disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these loci. In the initial phase of our study, we genotyped two putative functional SNPs in ubiquitin-specific protease 24 (USP24), a biological candidate gene within the chromosome 1 linkage region, and scanned the chromosome 2 linkage peak with 43 SNPs in a sample set of 224 PD cases and 186 matched controls. Both USP24 SNPs were significantly associated with disease risk (p = 0.0037 for rs1165222:T &gt; C, p.Thr195ILe, and p = 0.037 for rs13312:C &gt; G, a SNP in the 3'-untranslated region), and one marker, rs1048603:C &gt; T, p.Arg1123Cys, in USP40 was significant from the chromosome 2 scan (p = 0.038). Further genotyping of the region surrounding these initial markers led us to identify 19 additional SNPs with strong disease association. In the second phase, we genotyped the 22 significant markers in an additional 110 cases and 162 controls, which together with part of the initial sample set (201 cases and 149 controls) constitute an expanded sample set of 311 age- and gender-matched case-control pairs. Twenty-one markers were significant in the expanded sample set (most significant allelic p-value: 0.0006 for rs287235:C &gt; G on chromosome 1, and 0.005 for rs838552:T &gt; C on chromosome 2), and six SNPs in USP24 remained significant after conservatively adjusting for testing 27 markers (pBonferroni = 0.017-0.049). It is unlikely that population stratification contributed to this finding, as population stratification was undetectable in our sample set using 78 null markers. Our data suggest that genetic variants in USP24 and USP40 affect the risk for late-onset PD, which is consistent with the predicted role of the ubiquitination pathway in PD etiology.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="954" length="12"></location><text>p.Arg1123Cys</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1048603</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16780585</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Decorin and TGF-beta1 polymorphisms and development of COPD in a general population.		BACKGROUND: Decorin, an extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan, and TGF-beta1 are both involved in lung ECM turnover. Decorin and TGF-beta1 expression are decreased respectively increased in COPD lung tissue. Interestingly, they act as each other's feedback regulator. We investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in decorin and TGF-beta1 underlie accelerated decline in FEV1 and development of COPD in the general population. METHODS: We genotyped 1390 subjects from the Vlagtwedde/Vlaardingen cohort. Lung function was measured every 3 years for a period of 25 years. We tested whether five SNPs in decorin (3'UTR and four intron SNPs) and three SNPs in TGF-beta1 (3'UTR rs6957, C-509T rs1800469 and Leu10Pro rs1982073), and their haplotypes, were associated with COPD (last survey GOLD stage = II). Linear mixed effects models were used to analyze genotype associations with FEV1 decline. RESULTS: We found a significantly higher prevalence of carriers of the minor allele of the TGF-beta1 rs6957 SNP (p = 0.001) in subjects with COPD. Additionally, we found a significantly lower prevalence of the haplotype with the major allele of rs6957 and minor alleles for rs1800469 and rs1982073 SNPs in TGF-beta1 in subjects with COPD (p = 0.030), indicating that this association is due to the rs6957 SNP. TGF-beta1 SNPs were not associated with FEV1 decline. SNPs in decorin, and haplotypes constructed of both TGF-beta1 and decorin SNPs were not associated with development of COPD or with FEV1 decline. CONCLUSION: Our study shows for the first time that SNPs in decorin on its own or in interaction with SNPs in TGF-beta1 do not underlie the disturbed balance in expression between these genes in COPD. TGF-beta1 SNPs are associated with COPD, yet not with accelerated FEV1 decline in the general population.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="786" length="6"></location><text>C-509T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="807" length="8"></location><text>Leu10Pro</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1800469</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1800470</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17431880</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Functional profiling of uncommon VCAM1 promoter polymorphisms prevalent in African American populations.		Multiple variants of the vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) promoter show increased nucleotide heterozygosity in the African American population. Using a novel transfection-based transcriptional pathway profiling method, we show that select uncommon variants are functionally hyperactive. Eight candidate VCAM1 promoter haplotypes comprising 13 previously identified SNPs were assessed for response to known mitogens. Activity was correlated with bioinformatic analysis of hyper- and hyporesponsive variants to identify the gain or loss of haplotype-specific transcription factor binding site (TFBS). Using this approach, a low frequency regulatory allele (c.-540A&gt;G; dbSNP rs3783605:A&gt;G), found in a hyperactive VCAM1 promoter haplotype, was shown to create a candidate binding site for ETS2 that was confirmed in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation. This report provides the first functional evaluation of VCAM1 promoter polymorphisms and establishes a hypothetical foundation for investigation of their role in the pathogenesis of VCAM1-associated diseases that disproportionately afflict African Americans, including thromboembolic diseases, asthma, and multiple myeloma.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="765" length="9"></location><text>c.-540A&gt;G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3783605</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16962786</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor does not influence age at neurologic onset of Huntington's disease.		In Huntington's disease (HD), genetic factors in addition to the HD CAG repeat mutation play a significant role in determining age at neurologic onset. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a survival factor for striatal neurons, has been implicated as a target of regulation by huntingtin and is an attractive candidate as a genetic modifier. We tested this hypothesis by genotyping a SNP known to alter BDNF function (rs6265, also termed Val66Met) and a SNP associated with Alzheimer disease (BDNF C270T), along with two BDNF intronic SNPs (rs7103411, rs11030104), in 228 cases with extreme young onset and 329 cases with extreme old onset of HD. No differences were seen between groups for allele frequencies or genotype frequencies for any SNP. Furthermore, no association to onset age was seen in GEE models controlling for HD repeat size or in haplotype analyses of these SNPs. These results indicate that BDNF does not influence significantly the mechanisms in HD pathogenesis that lead to neurologic onset.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="547" length="8"></location><text>Val66Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6265</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16489054</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Haplotype analysis of the HSD17B1 gene and risk of breast cancer: a comprehensive approach to multicenter analyses of prospective cohort studies.		The 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 gene (HSD17B1) encodes 17HSD1, which catalyzes the final step of estradiol biosynthesis. Despite the important role of HSD17B1 in hormone metabolism, few epidemiologic studies of HSD17B1 and breast cancer have been conducted. This study includes 5,370 breast cancer cases and 7,480 matched controls from five large cohorts in the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium. We characterized variation in HSD17B1 by resequencing and dense genotyping a multiethnic sample and identified haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNP) that capture common variation within a 33.3-kb region around HSD17B1. Four htSNPs, including the previously studied SNP rs605059 (S312G), were genotyped to tag five common haplotypes in all cases and controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for disease. We found no evidence of association between common HSD17B1 haplotypes or htSNPs and overall risk of breast cancer. The OR for each haplotype relative to the most common haplotype ranged from 0.98 to 1.07 (omnibus test for association: X2 = 3.77, P = 0.58, 5 degrees of freedom). When cases were subdivided by estrogen receptor (ER) status, two common haplotypes were associated with ER-negative tumors (test for trend, Ps = 0.0009 and 0.0076; n = 353 cases). HSD17B1 variants that are common in Caucasians are not associated with overall risk of breast cancer; however, there was an association among the subset of ER-negative tumors. Although the probability that these ER-negative findings are false-positive results is high, these findings were consistent across each cohort examined and warrant further study.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="864" length="5"></location><text>S312G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs605059</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18204447</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Functional variants in the B-cell gene BANK1 are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.

We replicated the association in four independent case-control sets (combined P = 3.7 x 10(-10); OR = 1.38). We analyzed BANK1 cDNA and found two isoforms, one full-length and the other alternatively spliced and lacking exon 2 (Delta2), encoding a protein without a putative IP3R-binding domain. The transcripts were differentially expressed depending on a branch point-site SNP, rs17266594, in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs10516487. A third associated variant was found in the ankyrin domain (rs3733197, A383T).

We aimed to assess the possible contribution of the PAX4 transcription factor gene to the genetic background of type 1 diabetes. We analyzed four coding polymorphisms of the PAX4 gene in 498 cases with type 1 diabetes and 825 control subjects from Finland and Hungary. All patients were diagnosed under the age of 15 years according to the World Health Organization criteria. All four PAX4 variants (three in exon 9 and one in exon 3) were genotyped using DNA sequencing. In addition, all Finnish subjects were typed for HLA DR-DQ, insulin gene (-23) HphI, and CTLA4 CT60 polymorphisms. The +1,168 C/A coding variant of PAX4 was found to be polymorphic in both populations (P321H, rs712701). No difference was observed in the genotype frequencies between cases and control subjects, nor was any disease association detected when patients were stratified according to age at diagnosis, sex, HLA, insulin gene, or CTLA4 genotypes. Our data indicate that the +1,168 C/A variant of PAX4 gene does not play any essential role in genetic type 1 diabetes susceptibility. The strong coherence between the datasets of the two ethnic groups studied with highly contrasting disease incidence, socioeconomic characteristics, and profoundly diverse environment emphasizes the impact of this finding.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="688" length="10"></location><text>+1,168 C/A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="771" length="5"></location><text>P321H</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs712701</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs712701</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18193244</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association between P478S polymorphism of the filaggrin gene and risk of psoriasis in a Chinese population in Taiwan.

In total, 314 patients with psoriasis and 611 control subjects were analyzed for the presence of FLG R501X, 2282del4 mutations, and P478S (rs11584340, C/T base change) polymorphism by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The analysis revealed that both the R501X and 2282del4 mutations were not present in a subset of 200 patients (64%) with psoriasis. In contrast, a marginally significant difference (P = 0.020) was found in the distribution of rs11584340 genotype frequencies between psoriatic patients and controls. The frequency of the TT genotype in psoriasis patients was significantly higher than in controls (37.9% vs. 29.1%, respectively, P = 0.007). The T allele frequency of patients (60.5%) was also significantly higher than that of controls (53.9%) (P = 0.007). After adjusting for age and gender, carriers of the TT genotype were 1.46 (95% CI, 1.08-1.96) times more likely than non-carriers to have psoriasis (P = 0.013). In conclusion, our results suggest that FLG P478S polymorphism may confer susceptibility to the development of psoriasis among Taiwanese Chinese.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="20" length="5"></location><text>P478S</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11584340</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16893532</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Novel, replicated associations between dopamine D3 receptor gene polymorphisms and schizophrenia in two independent samples.		BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses have suggested an association between schizophrenia (SZ) and a coding polymorphism (rs6280/Ser9Gly) at the dopamine D3 receptor gene (DRD3), but results have been inconsistent. Because most studies have evaluated only rs6280, the inconsistencies might reflect associations with other variants. METHODS: We analyzed polymorphisms spanning 109kb in two independent samples (United States: 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 331 cases, 151 trios, 274 control subjects; India: 11 SNPs, 141 trios). RESULTS: In the U.S. samples, significant associations were detected with eight SNPs, including rs6280 (p = .001, odds ratio: 1.5). Consistent associations in the case-control and family-based analyses were detected with a common haplotype spanning intron 1 to the 3' region of the gene (rs324029-rs7625282-rs324030-rs2134655-rs10934254; case-control, p = .002; transmission disequilibrium test [TDT], p = .0009; global p-values = .002 and .007, respectively). In the Indian sample, one SNP was associated (rs10934254, p = .03). Moreover, over-transmission of the same common haplotype as the U.S. sample was observed in this cohort (TDT, p = .005; global test, p = .009). Ser9Gly (rs6280) was associated with SZ against this haplotype background but not other haplotypes. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest previous inconsistencies might have resulted from associations with other DRD3 variants. A liability locus might be in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with or carried against, an associated haplotype 3' to rs6280. Comprehensive SNP evaluation in larger samples is needed.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="243" length="7"></location><text>Ser9Gly</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6280</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17019603</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>PARL Leu262Val is not associated with fasting insulin levels in UK populations.		AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: PARL, the gene encoding presenilins-associated rhomboid-like protein, maps to chromosome 3q27 within a quantitative trait locus that influences components of the metabolic syndrome. Recently, an amino acid substitution (Leu262Val, rs3732581) in PARL was associated with fasting plasma insulin levels in a US white population (N=1031). This variant was also found to modify the positive association between age and fasting insulin. The aim of this study was to test whether these findings could be replicated in two UK population-based cohorts. METHODS: Participants from the Medical Research Council Ely and Hertfordshire cohort studies were genotyped for this variant using a SNaPshot primer extension assay and Taqman assay respectively. Full phenotypic and genotypic data were available for 3,666 study participants. RESULTS: Based on a dominant model, we found no association between the Leu262Val polymorphism and fasting insulin levels (p=0.79) or BMI (p=0.98). We did not observe the previously reported interaction between age and genotype on fasting insulin (p=0.14). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Despite having greater statistical power, our data do not support the previously reported association between PARL Leu262Val and fasting plasma insulin levels, a measure of insulin resistance. Our findings indicate that this variant is unlikely to be an important contributor to insulin resistance in UK populations.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="5" length="9"></location><text>Leu262Val</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3732581</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17322885</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A Mal functional variant is associated with protection against invasive pneumococcal disease, bacteremia, malaria and tuberculosis.		Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and members of their signaling pathway are important in the initiation of the innate immune response to a wide variety of pathogens. The adaptor protein Mal (also known as TIRAP), encoded by TIRAP (MIM 606252), mediates downstream signaling of TLR2 and TLR4 (refs. 4-6). We report a case-control study of 6,106 individuals from the UK, Vietnam and several African countries with invasive pneumococcal disease, bacteremia, malaria and tuberculosis. We genotyped 33 SNPs, including rs8177374, which encodes a leucine substitution at Ser180 of Mal. We found that heterozygous carriage of this variant associated independently with all four infectious diseases in the different study populations. Combining the study groups, we found substantial support for a protective effect of S180L heterozygosity against these infectious diseases (N = 6,106; overall P = 9.6 x 10(-8)).

PURPOSE: To investigate the contribution of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the lysyl oxidase-like 1 (LOXL1) gene, recently shown to be associated with exfoliation syndrome (XFS) and exfoliation glaucoma (XFG) in the Nordic population, to the occurrence of XFS and XFG in the Japanese population. DESIGN: Case-control association study. METHODS: A total of 59 unrelated Japanese individuals with XFS, 27 XFG patients, and 190 population-based controls were recruited. The SNPs rs1048661 (R141L) and rs3825942 (G153D) in the LOXL1 gene were genotyped directly. Association tests were performed for the two SNPs and inferred haplotypes. RESULTS: The frequency of the G allele in rs1048661, reportedly a functional risk allele in White persons, existed in only 0.8% of Japanese XFS cases, but occurred with much higher frequency in controls (46.0%) and yielded a P value of 3.0x10(-19), and the odds ratio for the T allele in rs1048661 was 99.8 (95% confidence interval, 13.8 to 722). For rs3825942, the frequency of the G allele, which is another possible risk allele in White persons with XFS, was 1.000 vs 0.857 in the controls (P=1.4x10(-5)). The most frequent haplotype in Japanese XFS patients was haplotype (T,G) (99.2%). The (G,G) haplotype, which generates the highest risk in White persons, was present in only a small percentage of Japanese XFS cases (0.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The SNPs rs1048661 and rs3825942 of the LOXL1 gene seem to be highly associated with XFS in the Japanese population, but a different polymorphism of LOXL1 may cause the development of XFS in the Japanese population.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="613" length="5"></location><text>G153D</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="591" length="5"></location><text>R141L</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3825942</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1048661</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17327457</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) sequence polymorphisms in type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetic traits.		Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is located within the region of linkage to type 2 diabetes on chromosome 1q21-q23 and is a key activator of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. We evaluated 78 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning &gt;213 kb in 95 people, from which we selected 64 SNPs for evaluation in 191 Caucasian case subjects from Utah and between 165 and 188 control subjects. Six SNPs showed nominal associations with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.001-0.04), including the nonsynonymous SNP rs1058405 (M67V) in exon 3 and rs11579627 in the 3' flanking region. Only rs1159627 remained significant on permutation testing. The associations were not replicated in 353 African-American case subjects and 182 control subjects, nor were ATF6 SNPs associated with altered insulin secretion or insulin sensitivity in nondiabetic Caucasian individuals. No association with type 2 diabetes was found in a subset of 44 SNPs in Caucasian (n = 2,099), Pima Indian (n = 293), and Chinese (n = 287) samples. Allelic expression imbalance was found in transformed lymphocyte cDNA for 3' untranslated region variants, thus suggesting cis-acting regulatory variants. ATF6 does not appear to play a major role in type 2 diabetes, but further work is required to identify the cause of the allelic expression imbalance.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="635" length="4"></location><text>M67V</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1058405</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17510212</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Common genetic variants and haplotypes in renal CLCNKA gene are associated to salt-sensitive hypertension.		Abnormal renal reabsorption of sodium (Na(+)) is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of salt-sensitivity. In the kidney, chloride channels CLC-Ka (gene CLCNKA) and CLC-Kb (gene CLCNKB) and their subunit Barttin (gene BSND) have important effects on the control of Na(+) and water homeostasis. We investigated if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or haplotypes within CLCNKA, CLCNKB and BSND loci affect salt-sensitivity in hypertensive subjects. Associations between blood pressure (BP) change after Na(+)-load and 15 SNPs spanning the length of CLCNKA and CLCNKB and six SNPs spanning the length of BSND were studied in 314 never treated essential hypertensives who underwent an i.v. infusion of saline (300 mm NaCl in 2 l H(2)O in 120 min). Four SNPs were significantly associated with BP change after Na-load. Rs848307 (P = 0.0026) and rs1739843 (P = 0.0023) map upstream the 5' of CLCNKA. Non-coding Rs1010069 (P = 0.0006) and non-synonymous rs1805152 (Thr447Ala; P = 0.0078) map within CLCNKA. Moreover, basal plasma renin activity and heart rate (measured before Na-load) were significantly lower in patients carrying the alleles associated with the larger mean BP increase after Na-load, indicating that such alleles are associated with chronic volume expansion. This study supports the candidacy of CLCNKA as a new susceptibility gene for salt-sensitivity.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1076" length="9"></location><text>Thr447Ala</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1805152</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18075470</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association between caffeine intake and risk of Parkinson's disease among fast and slow metabolizers.		INTRODUCTION: Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP 1A2) is responsible for more than 90% of caffeine clearance. A polymorphic variant of CYP1A2 (-163C&gt;A) (rs762551) is associated with high CYP1A2 inducibility. Both caffeine and its main metabolite, paraxanthine, may be neuroprotective. The association between caffeine intake and risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) in fast and slow caffeine metabolizers has not been compared. OBJECTIVE: In a case-control study, we analyzed the relationship between caffeine intake and risk of PD in both fast and slow caffeine metabolizers. METHODS: All the study participants were recruited prospectively, and interviewed for information on the amount and duration of caffeine intake. Genotyping of the CYP1A2 variant was carried out using the allelic discrimination method. RESULTS: Out of 1000 participants who were initially screened, 886 consisting of 418 PD and 468 race, sex and age matched controls were included. No evidence existed to suggest any association between CYP1A2 and the onset of PD (P=0.08). A significant association was seen between caffeine intake and the onset of PD (P=2.01x10(-5)), with the odds ratio for moderate and high drinkers at 0.71 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50-1.00] and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.34-0.65), respectively against the low drinkers. Multivariate analysis revealed no evidence of any interaction effects of caffeine with CYP1A2 (P=0.956). CONCLUSION: The association between caffeine intake and risk of PD was similarly observed in both fast and slow caffeine metabolizers, supporting experimental evidence in animal models that both caffeine and its major metabolite, paraxanthine, are neuroprotective.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="236" length="7"></location><text>-163C&gt;A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs762551</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17498296</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Surfactant protein B polymorphisms are associated with severe respiratory syncytial virus infection, but not with asthma.		BACKGROUND: Surfactant proteins (SP) are important for the innate host defence and essential for a physiological lung function. Several linkage and association studies have investigated the genes coding for different surfactant proteins in the context of pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or respiratory distress syndrome of preterm infants. In this study we tested whether SP-B was in association with two further pulmonary diseases in children, i. e. severe infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus and bronchial asthma. METHODS: We chose to study five polymorphisms in SP-B: rs2077079 in the promoter region; rs1130866 leading to the amino acid exchange T131I; rs2040349 in intron 8; rs3024801 leading to L176F and rs3024809 resulting in R272H. Statistical analyses made use of the Armitage's trend test for single polymorphisms and FAMHAP and FASTEHPLUS for haplotype analyses. RESULTS: The polymorphisms rs3024801 and rs3024809 were not present in our study populations. The three other polymorphisms were common and in tight linkage disequilibrium with each other. They did not show association with bronchial asthma or severe RSV infection in the analyses of single polymorphisms. However, haplotypes analyses revealed association of SP-B with severe RSV infection (p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: Thus our results indicate a possible involvement of SP-B in the genetic predisposition to severe RSV infections in the German population. In order to determine which of the three polymorphisms constituting the haplotypes is responsible for the association, further case control studies on large populations are necessary. Furthermore, functional analysis need to be conducted.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="870" length="5"></location><text>L176F</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="819" length="5"></location><text>T131I</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="903" length="5"></location><text>R272H</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3024801</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3024809</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1130866</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17623760</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Interleukin-6 genetic variability and adiposity: associations in two prospective cohorts and systematic review in 26,944 individuals.		CONTEXT: IL-6 (IL6) is an immune-modulating cytokine associated with obesity in humans. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the associations between the genetic variability of IL6 gene and adiposity and long-term changes. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We determined the linkage disequilibrium-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms of IL6 gene in 2255 healthy women and 980 healthy men from two prospective cohorts. We also conducted a metaanalysis on the associations between polymorphism -174G&gt;C (rs1800795) and adiposity. RESULTS: IL6 haplotype 222211 (possessing rs2069827, rs1800797, rs1800795, rs1554606, rs2069861, and rs1818879; 1 codes the common and 2 codes the minor alleles) was consistently and significantly associated with greater waist circumference (P = 0.009 in men; P = 0.0003 in women) and baseline body mass index (BMI) (P = 0.01 in men; P = 0.046 in women) compared with the most common haplotype 111112. Haplotype 222211 was also associated with significantly higher early-adulthood BMI in women (P = 0.007). The haplotype-associated difference in BMI persisted significantly during the follow-up. A 5' promoter polymorphism, rs2069827, was consistently associated with significantly higher early-adulthood BMI, baseline BMI, and waist circumference in men (carriers vs. noncarriers, P = 0.01, 0.007, and 0.008) and women (P = 0.01, 0.10, and 0.0016). The data from this study and a metaanalysis of 26,944 individuals did not support substantial relations between the best-studied polymorphism, -174G&gt;C, and adiposity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data from two independent cohorts indicate that the variability of the IL6 gene is significantly associated with adiposity. Such associations are less likely to be caused by polymorphism -174G&gt;C.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="620" length="7"></location><text>-174G&gt;C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1800795</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17983459</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene (VEGFA) polymorphism can predict the prognosis in acute myeloid leukaemia patients.		Increased angiogenesis, mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), was associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. The current study investigated the impact of VEGF gene (VEGFA) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on treatment outcomes for AML. Four VEGFA SNPs were analysed for -2578C&gt;A (rs699947), -460T&gt;C (rs833061), +405G&gt;C (rs2010963) and +936 C&gt;T (rs3025039) loci in 138 AML patients. The +936 CC/CT genotype showed strong correlation with favourable leukaemia-free survival (LFS) at 2 years (51.3%) versus with +936 CC genotype (33.6%, P = 0.03). Strong linkage disequilibrium was noted among loci -2578, -460 and +405, but not with +936. Accordingly, four haplotypes were generated based on the genotypes of -2578, -460 and +405 as follows: CTC (40.2%), CTG (35.0%), ACG (22.0%) and ATC (1.2%). The LFS and event-free survival (EFS) inversely correlated with CTG haplotype (P = 0.03 for LFS; P = 0.05 for EFS). We scored the VEGFA polymorphism marker based on +936 C&gt;T genotype and CTG haplotype for -2578, -460 and +405, which demonstrated a good correlation with the treatment outcomes: LFS (P = 0.01), EFS (P = 0.03) and overall survival (P = 0.01). The VEGFA +936 C&gt;T genotype and CTG haplotype seemed to have an additive effect to predict the prognosis in AML patients.</text><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="521" length="8"></location><text>+936 C&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="456" length="8"></location><text>-2578C&gt;A</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="477" length="7"></location><text>-460T&gt;C</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="497" length="7"></location><text>+405G&gt;C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs699947</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2010963</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3025039</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs833061</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>14984467</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic variation at the hormone sensitive lipase: gender-specific association with plasma lipid and glucose concentrations.		Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) catalyzes the intracellular hydrolysis of triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters, and it is involved in regulating body fat, steroidogenesis, and insulin secretion. Thus, genetic variability at the HSL locus (LIPE) may play a significant role on lipid metabolism and the risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we have examined two LIPE single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [14672C&gt;G in the promoter region and 17948C&gt;T (rs1206034) on intron 2] in relation to plasma lipids, anthropometrical and glucose-related phenotypes in a population of mostly overweight and obese men (373) and women (361). In women, the 17948T allele was associated with decreased total cholesterol (TC, p = 0.001), LDL-cholesterol (LDLc, p &lt; 0.001) and apoE concentrations (p = 0.041). Conversely, female carriers of the LIPE 14672G allele had significantly higher TC (p = 0.047), LDLc (p = 0.041), and apoE (p = 0.041) levels. Although we did not find significant associations in men, we observed that male carriers of the LIPE 14672G who did not drink alcohol showed higher glucose levels than non-carriers (p = 0.008), whereas there were no allele-related differences among drinkers (p = 0.019 for the interaction). These SNPs were not significantly associated with anthropometrical variables. In summary, variation at this locus showed gender-specific associations with lipids and glucose measures, and the latter was influenced by alcohol drinking.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="577" length="8"></location><text>17948C&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1206034</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17363416</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Reliable screening for a pain-protective haplotype in the GTP cyclohydrolase 1 gene (GCH1) through the use of 3 or fewer single nucleotide polymorphisms.		BACKGROUND: A haplotype in the GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (dopa-responsive dystonia) gene (GCH1) is associated with decreased persistent pain. The aim of the present study was to develop a screening method for the pain-protective haplotype. METHODS: Complete genetic information for all 15 GCH1 DNA positions constituting the pain-protective GCH1 haplotype was available from 278 patients. In silico analyses, including discriminant analysis of the most frequent haplotypes, identified distinctive DNA positions that allow detection of the pain-protective haplotype at high sensitivity and specificity with the smallest possible number of DNA positions. Pyrosequencing(trade mark) assays were subsequently developed for these DNA positions, established with 662 DNA samples from healthy volunteers, and prospectively validated with a random selection of DNA samples genotyped for all 15 DNA positions. RESULTS: Diagnosis of the pain-protective GCH1 haplotype was possible with 100% sensitivity and specificity by screening for just 3 GCH1 genetic variants that span the entire DNA range of the haplotype: c.-9610G&gt;A (dbSNP rs8007267G&gt;A) in the 5' untranslated region, c.343 + 8900A&gt;T (dbSNP rs3783641A&gt;T) in intron 1, and c.*4279 (dbSNP rs10483639C&gt;G) in the 3' untranslated region. Test sensitivity and specificity were still &gt;95% with 2 or even just 1 of these GCH1 DNA positions. CONCLUSIONS: In silico analysis of complex GCH1 gene haplotypes reduced the requisite number of tested DNA positions from 15 to 3 while maintaining the reliability, specificity, and sensitivity of the genetic diagnosis. This screening method could reduce laboratory diagnostic efforts and facilitate investigations of the pain-protective GCH1 haplotype.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1317" length="15"></location><text>c.343 + 8900A&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1254" length="10"></location><text>c.-9610G&gt;A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3783641</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs8007267</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15457404</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Functional analysis of genetic variation in catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT): effects on mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity in postmortem human brain.		Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is a key enzyme in the elimination of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex of the human brain. Genetic variation in the COMT gene (MIM 116790) has been associated with altered prefrontal cortex function and higher risk for schizophrenia, but the specific alleles and their functional implications have been controversial. We analyzed the effects of several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within COMT on mRNA expression levels (using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis), protein levels (using Western blot analysis), and enzyme activity (using catechol methylation) in a large sample (n = 108) of postmortem human prefrontal cortex tissue, which predominantly expresses the -membrane-bound isoform. A common coding SNP, Val158Met (rs4680), significantly affected protein abundance and enzyme activity but not mRNA expression levels, suggesting that differences in protein integrity account for the difference in enzyme activity between alleles. A SNP in intron 1 (rs737865) and a SNP in the 3' flanking region (rs165599)--both of which have been reported to contribute to allelic expression differences and to be associated with schizophrenia as part of a haplotype with Val--had no effect on mRNA expression levels, protein immunoreactivity, or enzyme activity. In lymphocytes from 47 subjects, we confirmed a similar effect on enzyme activity in samples with the Val/Met genotype but no effect in samples with the intron 1 or 3' SNPs. Separate analyses revealed that the subject's sex, as well as the presence of a SNP in the P2 promoter region (rs2097603), had small effects on COMT enzyme activity. Using site-directed mutagenesis of mouse COMT cDNA, followed by in vitro translation, we found that the conversion of Leu at the homologous position into Met or Val progressively and significantly diminished enzyme activity. Thus, although we cannot exclude a more complex genetic basis for functional effects of COMT, Val is a predominant factor that determines higher COMT activity in the prefrontal cortex, which presumably leads to lower synaptic dopamine levels and relatively deleterious prefrontal function.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="937" length="9"></location><text>Val158Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4680</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17984110</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Selected base excision repair gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to biliary tract cancer and biliary stones: a population-based case-control study in China.		Base excision repair (BER) corrects DNA damage caused by oxidative stress and chronic inflammation, putative risk factors for cancer. To understand the relationship between genetic variation in BER genes and risk of biliary tract cancer and biliary stones, we examined non-synonymous polymorphisms in three key BER genes-x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) (R194W, rs1799782; R280H, rs25489 and R399Q, rs25487), apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APEX1) (D148E, rs3136820) and 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) (S326C, rs1052133), in a population-based study of 411 biliary tract cancer cases (237 gallbladder, 127 bile duct and 47 ampulla of Vater), 891 biliary (gallbladder or bile duct) stone cases and 786 population controls conducted in Shanghai, China. Compared with subjects carrying the XRCC1 194RR genotype, those with the WW genotype had a 1.9-fold risk of bile duct cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 1.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-3.5, P(trend) = 0.03], and compared with subjects carrying the XRCC1 280RR genotype, those with the XRCC1 280H allele had a 50% reduced risk of bile duct cancer (OR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.9, P(trend) = 0.05). The effect of the R280H polymorphism persisted (P(trend) = 0.03), when all three XRCC1 polymorphisms were jointly considered in the model, a finding supported by the haplotype results (covariate-adjusted global permutation P = 0.03). We also found an inverse association between the APEX1 148E allele and gallbladder stones (P(trend) = 0.03), but no association for the OGG1 polymorphism. This study suggests that genetic variants in XRCC1 and APEX1 may alter susceptibility to biliary tract cancer and stones. Further studies are required to confirm the reported associations.</text><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="569" length="5"></location><text>R399Q</text></annotation><annotation id="T5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="689" length="5"></location><text>S326C</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="630" length="5"></location><text>D148E</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="550" length="5"></location><text>R280H</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="532" length="5"></location><text>R194W</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1130409</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1799782</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1052133</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T5" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs25487</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs25489</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18159088</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of FSH receptor and CYP19A1 gene variations with sterility and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.		Severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a potentially life-threatening complication during assisted reproduction technology (ART). The aetiology of this condition is still not fully understood. Several gene variations in the FSH receptor (FSHR) gene have been identified for the very rare cases of spontaneous OHSS. There are only few published data on gene variations in sterility and iatrogenic OHSS and no data regarding aromatase (cytochrome P450 19A1; CYP19A1). Ninety-one ART patients with OHSS, eighty-eight ART patients without OHSS and ninety-seven women with assumed normal fecundity were analysed for the FSHR single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) gene variations Asn680Ser (rs6166), Ala189Val, Ile160Thr, Thr449Ile (rs28928870) and the CYP19A1 rs10046 locus using real-time PCR. In addition, exon 10 of FSHR of two patients with spontaneous hyperreactio luteinalis (HL) was sequenced. Significantly lower frequencies of homozygous Ser680/Ser680 (P=0.035) and heterozygous Thr160/Ile160 (P=0.039) were found in patients with normal fecundity than those undergoing ART. The Ile160Thr SNP with a frequency of 6.7 and 6.1% in ART patients with and without OHSS respectively does not represent a rare mutation as previously published. There were no differences in the frequencies of all other gene variations. Of two patients with HL, both had homozygous point mutations for Ser680/Ser680 and one was heterozygous for Ile160Thr and CYP19A1 rs10046. The FSHR gene variations Asn680Ser as well as Ile160Thr may be contributing factors in unexplained sterility. The other FSHR coding gene variations and CYP19A1 rs10046 investigated are most likely not involved in the aetiology of iatrogenic OHSS or sterility.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="796" length="9"></location><text>Asn680Ser</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="838" length="9"></location><text>Thr449Ile</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6166</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs28928870</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16873704</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association studies of variants in the genes involved in pancreatic beta-cell function in type 2 diabetes in Japanese subjects.		Because impaired insulin secretion is characteristic of type 2 diabetes in Asians, including Japanese, the genes involved in pancreatic beta-cell function are candidate susceptibility genes for type 2 diabetes. We examined the association of variants in genes encoding several transcription factors (TCF1, TCF2, HNF4A, ISL1, IPF1, NEUROG3, PAX6, NKX2-2, NKX6-1, and NEUROD1) and genes encoding the ATP-sensitive K(+) channel subunits Kir6.2 (KCNJ11) and SUR1 (ABCC8) with type 2 diabetes in a Japanese cohort of 2,834 subjects. The exon 16 -3c/t variant rs1799854 in ABCC8 showed a significant association (P = 0.0073), and variants in several genes showed nominally significant associations (P &lt; 0.05) with type 2 diabetes. Although the E23K variant rs5219 in KCNJ11 showed no association with diabetes in Japanese (for the K allele, odds ratio [OR] 1.08 [95% CI 0.97-1.21], P = 0.15), 95% CI around the OR overlaps in meta-analysis of European populations, suggesting that our results are not inconsistent with the previous studies. This is the largest association study so far conducted on these genes in Japanese and provides valuable information for comparison with other ethnic groups.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="867" length="4"></location><text>E23K</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="661" length="13"></location><text>exon 16 -3c/t</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5219</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1799854</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16144952</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Sex-specific association between estrogen receptor-alpha gene variation and measures of adiposity: the Framingham Heart Study.		BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1) may be associated with variation in body mass index and waist circumference. However, most prior studies have been limited by sample size and power. METHODS: DNA from 1763 unrelated men and women (mean age, 56 yr) from the Framingham Heart Study offspring cohort was genotyped for four ESR1 polymorphisms: T30C (rs2077647) in exon 1, PvuII (rs2234693), and XbaI (rs 9340799) in intron 1, and C1335G (rs 1801132) in exon 4. RESULTS: Men homozygous for the PvuII C allele (frequency, 0.45) had lower waist circumference (99.3 cm), compared with TT homozygous men (99.8 cm) and heterozygotes (100.6 cm) (P &lt; 0.004). Similar results were obtained with XbaI, which lies in the same linkage disequilibrium block. C1335G also demonstrated a gender-specific association: men with CG or GG genotypes had lower mean body mass index, 27.7 and 27.9 kg/m2 respectively, compared with 28.6 kg/m2 among the CC homozygotes (P &lt; 0.01). No significant associations were seen with T30C, nor were associations observed among women. CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in ESR1 are associated with measures of adiposity in men. These associations further support the hypothesis that the intron 1 region of ESR1 influences phenotypes important for cardiovascular risk.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="580" length="6"></location><text>C1335G</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1150" length="4"></location><text>T30C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1801132</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2077647</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15615772</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Elevated amyloid beta protein (Abeta42) and late onset Alzheimer's disease are associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms in the urokinase-type plasminogen activator gene.		Plasma amyloid beta protein (Abeta42) levels and late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) have been linked to the same region on chromosome 10q. The PLAU gene within this region encodes urokinase-type plasminogen activator, which converts plasminogen to plasmin. Abeta aggregates induce PLAU expression thereby increasing plasmin, which degrades both aggregated and non-aggregated forms of Abeta. We evaluated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PLAU for association with Abeta42 and LOAD. PLAU SNP compound genotypes composed of haplotype pairs showed significant association with AD in three independent case-control series. PLAU SNP haplotypes associated significantly with plasma Abeta42 in 10 extended LOAD families. One of the SNPs analyzed was a missense C/T polymorphism in exon 6 of PLAU (PLAU_1=rs2227564), which causes a proline to leucine change (P141L). We analyzed PLAU_1 for association with AD in six case-control series and 24 extended LOAD families. The CT and TT PLAU_1 genotypes showed association (P=0.05) with an overall estimated odds ratio of 1.2 (1.0-1.5). The CT and TT genotypes of PLAU_1 were also associated with significant age-dependent elevation of plasma Abeta42 in 24 extended LOAD families (P=0.0006). In knockout mice lacking the PLAU gene, plasma--but not brain--Abeta42 as well as Abeta40 was significantly elevated, also in an age-dependent manner. The PLAU_1 associations were independent of the associations we found among plasma Abeta42, LOAD and variants in the IDE or VR22 region. These results provide strong evidence that PLAU or a nearby gene is involved in the development of LOAD. PLAU_1 is a plausible pathogenic mutation that could act by increasing Abeta42, but additional biological experiments are required to show this definitively.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1040" length="5"></location><text>P141L</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2227564</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18034366</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Lack of replication of genetic associations with human longevity.		The exceptional longevity of centenarians is due in part to inherited genetic factors, as deduced from data that show that first degree relatives of centenarians live longer and have reduced overall mortality. In recent years, a number of groups have performed genetic association studies on long-living individuals (LLI) and young controls to identify alleles that are either positively or negatively selected in the centenarian population as consequence of a demographic pressure. Many of the reported studies have shown genetic loci associated with longevity. Of these, with the exception of APOE, none have been convincingly reproduced. We validated our populations by typing the APOE locus. In addition, we used 749 American Caucasian LLI, organized in two independent tiers and 355 American Caucasian controls in the attempt to replicate previously published findings. We tested Klotho (KL)-VS variant (rs952706), Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein (CETP) I405V (rs5882), Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) Q192R (rs662), Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) -641C/A (rs2542052), Microsomal Transfer Protein (MTP) -493G/T (rs2866164) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon2 and epsilon4 isoforms, (rs7412 and rs429358) haplotypes respectively.

Recent evidences suggest that the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma, which is an important transcriptional factor in adipocyte differentiation, also plays an important role in the bone microenvironment. The objective of the study was to clarify whether Pro12Ala polymorphism was related to the serum OPG levels and bone mineral metabolism in healthy Korean women. In 239 Korean women (mean age 51 years), who participated in medical check-up program in a health promotion center, anthropometric measurements, lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD), bone turnover markers, such as serum total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels, urine deoxypyridinoline levels, and 24-h urine calcium excretion were measured. Serum levels of OPG were measured with ELISA method. DNAs were extracted from the samples and the genotyping of the Pro12Ala polymorphism (rs1801282) in the PPAR-gamma gene was performed via an allelic discrimination assay using a TaqMan probe. In addition, we examined the haplotype analysis between two polymorphisms of PPAR-gamma gene, Pro12Ala in exon B and C161T in exon 6 (rs3856806). Allelic frequencies were 0.950 for Pro allele and 0.050 for Ala allele, which was in compliance with Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium, and there was no Ala12Ala genotype among the genotyped subjects. Mean serum OPG level was significantly lower (P=0.035), and serum total ALP was significantly higher (P=0.014) in the Pro12Ala genotype group compared with the Pro12Pro genotype group, which were consistently significant even after adjustment for weight, height, and serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). In multiple regression analysis with serum OPG as the dependent variable and age, weight, ALP, femoral neck BMD and Pro12Ala genotype included in the model, only Pro12Ala genotype was significant determinant of serum OPG level (b=??0.136, P=0.035). The haplotype analysis with C161T polymorphism revealed that subjects with Ala and T alleles showed significantly lower serum OPG levels compared with those with Pro12Pro/CC genotype, which were consistently significant even after adjustment for age, weight, height and FSH (P=0.010). This result suggests statistically significant association of Pro12Ala polymorphisms with serum OPG levels in Korean females.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="19" length="8"></location><text>Pro12Ala</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1801282</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18006912</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>CYP17 genetic variation and risk of breast and prostate cancer from the National Cancer Institute Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3).		CYP17 encodes cytochrome p450c17alpha, which mediates activities essential for the production of sex steroids. Common germ line variation in the CYP17 gene has been related to inconsistent results in breast and prostate cancer, with most studies focusing on the nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) T27C (rs743572). We comprehensively characterized variation in CYP17 by direct sequencing of exons followed by dense genotyping across the 58 kb region around CYP17 in five racial/ethnic populations. Two blocks of strong linkage disequilibrium were identified and nine haplotype-tagging SNPs, including T27C, were chosen to predict common haplotypes (R(h)(2) &gt;or= 0.85). These haplotype-tagging SNPs were genotyped in 8,138 prostate cancer cases and 9,033 controls, and 5,333 breast cancer cases and 7,069 controls from the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium. We observed borderline significant associations with prostate cancer for rs2486758 [TC versus TT, odds ratios (OR), 1.07; 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), 1.00-1.14; CC versus TT, OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.95-1.26; P trend=0.04] and rs6892 (AG versus AA, OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.15; GG versus AA, OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.95-1.30; P trend=0.03). We also observed marginally significant associations with breast cancer for rs4919687 (GA versus GG, OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97-1.12, AA versus GG, OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03-1.34; P trend=0.03) and rs4919682 (CT versus CC, OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.97-1.12; TT versus CC, OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.01-1.33; P trend=0.04).

OBJECTIVE: Obesity is associated with increased plasma levels of plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI1), the major fibrinolysis inhibitor. PAI1 levels are also increased at menopause, a condition that is associated with fat mass gain, especially in the abdominal area. DESIGN: We hypothesized that genetic variations within PAI1 gene are related to the amount of body fat and its regional distribution. We genotyped 666 subjects of the Quebec Family Study for five PAI1 gene polymorphisms. Stratified analyses were performed with analysis of covariance in men (n = 280) and women (n = 386) separately. RESULTS: PAI1-675 4G/5G polymorphism was strongly associated with body mass index (P &lt; or = 0.01) and fat mass (P &lt; or = 0.05) in women. The PAI1-675 4G/5G promoter polymorphism and the c.43G&lt;A (p.A15T, rs6092) variant within the exon 1 were associated with abdominal visceral fat but only in postmenopausal women (P &lt; or = 0.05). More specifically, homozygotes for the -675 5G and the 43A alleles had about 50% more visceral fat compared to carriers of the -675 4G allele as well as carriers of the 43G allele. No association was observed in men. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results suggest that the PAI1 gene is associated with obesity and may modulate the changes in adipose tissue distribution generally observed at menopause.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="957" length="7"></location><text>c.43G&lt;A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="966" length="6"></location><text>p.A15T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6092</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6092</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17678845</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Replication of an association between IL23R gene polymorphism with inflammatory bowel disease.		BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Recently, the interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R) gene encoding a subunit of the receptor of the inflammatory cytokine IL-23 has been identified as a novel genetic factor strongly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to replicate the IBD association of IL23R genetic markers in an IBD independent Spanish cohort. METHODS: Four hundred sixty IBD patients of Spanish white origin (238 CD and 222 UC) and 342 ethnically matched healthy controls comprised the study population. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the IL23R gene and its downstream intergenic region were selected as genetic markers and genotyped by using Taqman 5' allelic discrimination assay. RESULTS: All genetic variants located within the IL23R gene were observed to confer a strong protective effect against IBD susceptibility in our population. The Arg381Gln (rs11209026) non-synonymous SNP was most significantly associated with IBD protection (odds ratio, 0.4; 95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.7). In addition to the single SNP analysis, we performed a haplotype analysis identifying 2 haplotypes significantly associated with IBD protection. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we replicate the association of IL23R genetic variants with IBD in a Spanish population. These findings, together with the previous results, suggest that the IL23R gene is one of the genetic factors implicated in the genetics of IBD in the general population.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="970" length="9"></location><text>Arg381Gln</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11209026</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17701054</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Interaction between the UCP2-866G/A, mtDNA 10398G/A and PGC1alpha p.Thr394Thr and p.Gly482Ser polymorphisms in type 2 diabetes susceptibility in North Indian population.		In the recent past, we have observed a possible role of 10398A and 16189C mtDNA and PGC1alpha p.Thr394Thr (rs2970847) and p.Gly482Ser (rs8192673) variant genotypes providing susceptibility/protection against type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in two North Indian population groups. These initial observations encouraged us to look at the candidate genes in combination with -866G/A (rs659366) polymorphism in uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) in a single study of a relatively large sample size, constituted of both the cohorts, to unravel an interesting outcome of an additive interaction in-between the studied genes. In a total of 1,686 individuals (762 cases and 924 controls) belonging to Indo-European linguistic group from North India, a comparison of risk genotype combinations of: UCP2-866GG, mtDNA 10398A and PGC1alpha p.Thr394Thr or p.Gly482Ser against the protective genotypes: UCP2-866XA, mtDNA 10398G and PGC1alpha p.Thr394Thr (nominal P value = 1.75 x 10(-14), Odds ratio, OR = 5.29, 3.40-8.22 at 95% CI) or PGC1alpha p.Gly482Ser (nominal p value = 4.42 x 10(-24), OR = 8.59, 5.53-13.35 at 95% CI), showed a highly significant difference and increased ORs. In a complex disease, it is always encouraging to find an additive interaction of multiple small effects of the studied candidate gene variations.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="28" length="8"></location><text>-866G/A,</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="66" length="11"></location><text>p.Thr394Thr</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="82" length="11"></location><text>p.Gly482Ser</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs659366</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs8192673</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2970847</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17962488</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Coding and noncoding variants in the CFH gene and cigarette smoking influence the risk of age-related macular degeneration in a Japanese population.		PURPOSE: Ethnic variation has been reported in age-related macular degeneration (AMD)-associated Y402H polymorphism in complement factor H (CFH). This variation is evident in the Japanese population. Recently a strong association between a novel single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs1410996) in the CFH gene and AMD has been identified in Caucasian patients. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether four coding and noncoding variants of the CFH gene, including rs1410996, are associated with AMD in native, unrelated Japanese patients. METHODS: A total of 188 patients with AMD and 139 control subjects without AMD were recruited for the study. Four SNPs (rs800292, rs1061170, rs1410996, and rs2274700) in the CFH gene were assessed by genotyping assay. The information regarding systemic conditions and lifestyle including smoking were documented in each subject by standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: The intronic SNP (rs1410996) and the synonymous SNP (rs2274700) were associated with a significant risk of AMD (P = 2.37 x 10(-5) and 3.52 x 10(-5), respectively). A significant association was also noted between a coding variant (rs800292, I62V) and AMD (P = 8.63 x 10(-6)). In contrast, the Y402H variant showed no significant association with AMD (P = 0.101). Two common haplotypes also demonstrated significant association with AMD (P = 1.08 x 10(-3) and 2.00 x 10(-5)). Among the environmental factors, smoking alone had a significant association with AMD (P = 1.17 x 10(-4)). CONCLUSIONS: Although the Y402H variant was not significantly associated with AMD, other coding and noncoding variants in the CFH gene including rs1410996 and smoking moderately influenced the risk of AMD in a Japanese population.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1313" length="4"></location><text>I62V</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs800292</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17495420</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic polymorphism of bile acid CoA: amino acid N-acyltransferase in Japanese individuals.

Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF or SERPINF1), a neuroprotective and anti-angiogenic factor, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). In 416 patients with type 2 diabetes, four polymorphisms in the PEDF SNPs were identified, rs12150053 and rs12948385 in the promoter region, rs9913583 in the 5'-untranslated region, and rs1136287 (Met72Thr) in exon 3. Based on case-control studies, rs12150053 and rs12948385, but not rs9913583 and rs1136287, were significantly associated with DR. A logistic regression analysis revealed that the TC or CC genotype of rs12150053 was a significant risk factor for DR (odds ratio 2.40, p=0.0004). The GA or AA genotype of rs12948385 was also a significant risk factor for DR. In addition, a significant interaction between the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and PEDF SNPs in the susceptibility to DR was found. These results demonstrate that the PEDF gene, in cooperation with the VEGF gene, may contribute to the development of DR.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="486" length="8"></location><text>Met72Thr</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1136287</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16368448</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association between human atrial natriuretic peptide Val7Met polymorphism and baseline blood pressure, plasma trough irbesartan concentrations, and the antihypertensive efficacy of irbesartan in rural Chinese patients with essential hypertension.		BACKGROUND: Individual variations in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antihypertensive drugs are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The ANP gene, which encodes the precursor of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), is among the candidate genes for genetic susceptibility to hypertension. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the relationship between ANP Val7Met polymorphism (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database ID: rs5063) and baseline blood pressure (BP), plasma trough irbesartan concentrations, and the antihypertensive efficacy of irbesartan in rural Chinese patients with essential hypertension. METHODS: Patients with essential hypertension who had taken no antihypertensive medications within 4 weeks of study initiation received oral irbesartan 150 mg/d for 4 weeks. Genotyping was performed for all patients. BP was measured before dosing on the 1st and 28th days of treatment. Plasma irbesartan concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescent detection. Antihypertensive efficacy was defined as attainment of a diastolic BP (DBP) &lt;90 mm Hg (DBP analysis), a systolic BP (SBP) &lt;140 mm Hg (SBP analysis), and a DBP &lt;90 mm Hg and SBP &lt;140 mm Hg (DBP and SBP analysis). RESULTS: The study included 756 patients, 621 with the Val/Val genotype and 135 with the Val/Met+Met/Met genotypes. There were no significant differences in age, body mass index, sex, education level, occupation, alcohol consumption, or smoking status between the 2 groups. Patients with the Val/Met+Met/Met genotypes had a significantly lower mean baseline DBP compared with those with the Val/Val genotype (adjusted regression coefficient [SE]: -2.5 [1.0] mm Hg; P = 0.012) and significantly lower mean steady-state plasma trough irbesartan concentrations (adjusted regression coefficient: -12.6 [4.1]; P = 0.002). No significant association was found between antihypertensive efficacy and Val7Met polymorphism in the overall population, but in an analysis by baseline DBP status, patients with the Val/Met+Met/Met genotype a baseline DBP &gt; or =100 mm Hg had significantly smaller reductions in DBP (adjusted regression coefficient: -5.7 [1.4] mm Hg; P &lt; 0.001) and SBP compared with those with the Val/Val genotype and a baseline DBP &gt; or =100 mm Hg (adjusted regression coefficient: -9.8 [2.9] mm Hg; P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that in these rural Chinese patients with essential hypertension, ANP Val7Met polymorphism may be a genetic marker for baseline DBP, plasma irbesartan concentrations, and the antihypertensive efficacy of short-term irbesartan therapy.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="53" length="7"></location><text>Val7Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5063</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17712123</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Single nucleotide polymorphisms at the adiponectin locus and risk of coronary heart disease in men and women.		OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the association of 5 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the adiponectin locus with risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in men and women. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We genotyped five common SNPs in the adiponectin gene (rs266729, -11365C&gt;G; rs822395, -4034A&gt;C; rs822396, -3964A&gt;G; rs2241766, +45T&gt;G; and rs1501299, +276G&gt;T) in men (Health Professionals Follow-up Study) and women (Nurses' Health Study) in a nested case control setting. Among participants free of cardiovascular disease at baseline, 266 men and 249 women developed non-fatal myocardial infarction or fatal CHD during 6 and 8 years of follow-up, respectively. In addition, 564 men had coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Using risk set sampling, controls were selected 2:1 matched on age, smoking, and date of blood draw. RESULTS: The -4034CC genotype was related to an increased risk of non-fatal myocardial infarction or fatal CHD compared with the AA genotype [relative risk (RR), men, 1.69; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99 to 2.89; women, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.20 to 3.49); however, this genotype was not related to risk of coronary artery bypass graft surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or to plasma adiponectin levels. Other SNPs or haplotypes defined by the 5 SNPs were not consistently related to risk of CHD in men and women or to plasma adiponectin levels. DISCUSSION: Our study does not support the hypothesis that these 5 common SNPs in the adiponectin gene play an important role in the development of CHD among men and women, although we cannot exclude an association between the -4034CC genotype and risk of CHD.</text><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="413" length="8"></location><text>-4034A&gt;C</text></annotation><annotation id="T5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="454" length="6"></location><text>+45T&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="392" length="9"></location><text>-11365C&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="433" length="8"></location><text>-3964A&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="477" length="7"></location><text>+276G&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs266729</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1501299</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2241766</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T5" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs822395</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs822396</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17066261</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of a novel non-coding RNA, MIAT, that confers risk of myocardial infarction.		Through a large-scale case-control association study using 52,608 haplotype-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, we identified a susceptible locus for myocardial infarction (MI) on chromosome 22q12.1. Following linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping, haplotype analyses revealed that six SNPs in this locus, all of which were in complete LD, showed markedly significant association with MI (chi2=25.27, P=0.0000005; comparison of allele frequency, 3,435 affected individuals versus 3,774 controls, in the case of intron 1 5,338 C&gt;T; rs2331291). Within this locus, we isolated a complete cDNA of a novel gene, designated myocardial infarction associated transcript (MIAT). MIAT has five exons, and in vitro translation assay showed that MIAT did not encode any translational product, indicating that this is likely to be a functional RNA. In vitro functional analyses revealed that the minor variant of one SNP in exon 5 increased transcriptional level of the novel gene. Moreover, unidentified nuclear protein(s) bound more intensely to risk allele than non-risk allele. These results indicate that the altered expression of MIAT by the SNP may play some role in the pathogenesis of MI.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="629" length="7"></location><text>338 C&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2331291</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16204371</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Variants in the ghrelin gene are associated with metabolic syndrome in the Old Order Amish.		CONTEXT: Mature ghrelin has been shown to stimulate eating and to participate in the regulation of insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis. Its gene, GHRL, is located on chromosome 3 in a region where we have shown linkage to eating behavior, percentage body fat, and total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in subjects of the Amish Family Diabetes Study. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine whether mutations in GHRL might influence eating behavior and risk for metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, and related traits. DESIGN: We genotyped 856 Amish samples for three missense polymorphisms in GHRL, Arg51Gln, Leu72Met (rs696217), and Gln90Leu (rs4684677) and performed association analyses with eating behavior traits and metabolic syndrome as defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. SUBJECTS: Our subjects were adult participants in the Amish Family Diabetes Study. RESULTS: The allele frequencies of these variants were 0.03, 0.04, and 0.03, respectively. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was lower among those carrying the 51Gln allele (3.8 vs. 15.8%; age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio = 0.22; P = 0.031). Hunger scores tended to be lower among 51Gln allele carriers but did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07). The Leu72Met variant was also associated with increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome (23.2 vs. 13.4%; age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio = 2.57; P = 0.02) as well as higher fasting glucose, lower high-density lipoprotein, and higher triglyceride levels (P = 0.02, P = 0.007, and P = 0.04, respectively). The two variants were not in linkage disequilibrium with each other, suggesting independent effects. We conclude that mutations in GHRL may confer risk for the metabolic syndrome.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="752" length="8"></location><text>Gln90Leu</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="727" length="8"></location><text>Leu72Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4684677</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs696217</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17604122</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A quantitative association study between schizotypal traits and COMT, PRODH and BDNF genes in a healthy Chinese population.		Previous studies have suggested that catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), proline dehydrogenase (PRODH), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) genes are possible susceptibility genes for schizophrenia. We hypothesized that these genes are also associated with schizotypal traits, which are heritable and related to schizophrenia. We genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) from the COMT, PRODH and BDNF genes, and performed a series of association analyses between alleles, genotypes or haplotypes, and quantitative schizotypal trait scores derived from the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), in 465 Chinese healthy subjects. We found that 'years of education' was a major influence on seven out of nine schizotypal components, three schizotypal factors and the total SPQ scores. Molecular genetic analysis of COMT, PRODH and BDNF genes showed no significant effects of any variants on schizotypal components or factors of SPQ after correction for multiple testing, although there were weak association between COMT Val158Met (rs4680G/A) and the odd speech subscale (allele-wise, P=0.04; genotype-wise, P=0.049), between COMT Val158Met (rs4680G/A) and the suspiciousness subscale (genotype-wise, P=0.024), and between BDNF Val66Met and the Factor 2 interpersonal measure (genotype-wise, P=0.027) before correction. Furthermore, we found SNP Val158Met (rs4680) of the COMT gene significantly influenced the scores of some of schizotypal traits including total SPQ score, the disorganization factor and the constricted affect subscale in male subjects only. However, the effect was in the opposite direction of an earlier association with the SPQ reported by Avramopoulos et al. [Avramopoulos, D., Stefanis, N.C., Hantoumi, I., Smyrnis, N., Evdokimidis, I., Stefanis, C.N., 2002. Higher scores of self reported schizotypy in healthy young males carrying the COMT high activity allele. Molecular Psychiatry 7, 706-711]. We conclude that SNP Val158Met (rs4680) in the COMT gene may be associated with some schizotypal traits in male subjects, but our results are not conclusive.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1171" length="9"></location><text>Val158Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4680</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17701750</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>The XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism and breast cancer risk: a case-control study in a Thai population.		The X-ray repair cross-complementing group 3 gene (XRCC3) belongs to a family of genes responsible for repairing DNA double-strand breaks caused by normal metabolic processes and exposure to ionizing radiation. Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes may alter an individual's capacity to repair damaged DNA and may lead to genetic instability and contribute to malignant transformation. We examined the role of a polymorphism in the XRCC3 gene (rs861529; codon 241: threonine to methionine change) in determining breast cancer risk in Thai women. The study population consisted of 507 breast cancer cases and 425 healthy women. The polymorphism was analysed by fluorescence-based melting curve analysis. The XRCC3 241Met allele was found to be uncommon in the Thai population (frequency 0.07 among cases and 0.05 among controls). Odds ratios (OR) adjusted for age, body mass index, age at menarche, family history of breast cancer, menopausal status, reproduction parameters, use of contraceptives, tobacco smoking, involuntary tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and education were calculated for the entire population as well as for pre- and postmenopausal women. There was a significant association between 241Met carrier status and breast cancer risk (OR 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.44). Among postmenopausal women, a slightly higher OR (1.82, 95% CI 0.95-3.51) was found than among premenopausal women (OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.82-2.69). Our findings suggest that the XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism is likely to play a modifying role in the individual susceptibility to breast cancer among Thai women as already shown for women of European ancestry.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="10" length="9"></location><text>Thr241Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs861539</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17984249</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Polymorphisms in the interleukin-6 receptor gene are associated with bone mineral density and body mass index in Spanish postmenopausal women.		OBJECTIVE: Osteoporosis and obesity are complex diseases with a strong genetic component. Bone mineral density (BMD) and body mass index (BMI) linkage studies identified a locus at 1q21-23, where the interleukin-6 receptor (IL6R) gene is located. The IL6R and the gp130 receptors are the mediators of IL6 action. Serum levels of IL6 and sIL6R (the soluble form of IL6R) are higher in several diseases such as osteoporosis or obesity. Variants at IL6R have been associated with BMI and obesity. However, IL6R is an as-yet-unexplored osteoporosis candidate gene. DESIGN: In the present study we analysed two polymorphisms in the IL6R promoter, -1435 C/T (rs3887104) and -208 G/A (rs4845617), and the Asp358Ala polymorphism (rs8192284), in relation to both BMD and BMI in a cohort of 559 postmenopausal Spanish women. RESULTS: The promoter polymorphisms, -1435 C/T and -208 G/A were associated with femoral neck (FN) BMD (P=0.011 and P=0.025 respectively). The C-A and T-G promoter haplotypes were also associated with FN BMD. Additionally, the Asp358Ala variant was associated with lumbar spine BMD (P=0.038). Finally, the -208 G/A polymorphism and the C-G and C-A haplotypes were associated with BMI and obesity, where GG was the risk genotype (P=0.033 for BMI; P=0.010 for obesity). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that variants in the IL6R gene are not only involved in the determination of BMI but also relevant for the determination of BMD. The IL6R gene may belong to the growing list of genes known to be involved in both phenotypes.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="786" length="9"></location><text>-1435 C/T</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="842" length="9"></location><text>Asp358Ala</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="812" length="8"></location><text>-208 G/A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3887104</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4845617</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2228145</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17263791</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Elevated plasma fibrinogen gamma' concentration is associated with myocardial infarction: effects of variation in fibrinogen genes and environmental factors.		BACKGROUND: Fibrinogen gamma', a fibrinogen gamma-chain variant generated via alternative mRNA processing, has been associated with susceptibility to thrombotic disease. OBJECTIVE: The present case-control study searched for potential determinants of the plasma fibrinogen gamma' concentration and examined the relationship between this variant and risk of myocardial infarction (MI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Stockholm Coronary Artery Risk Factor study, comprising 387 postinfarction patients and 387 healthy individuals, was employed. The fibrinogen gamma (FGG) 9340T &gt; C [rs1049636], fibrinogen alpha (FGA) 2224G &gt; A [rs2070011] and fibrinogen beta (FGB) 1038G &gt; A [rs1800791] polymorphisms were determined. The plasma fibrinogen gamma' concentration was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The multifactor dimensionality reduction method was used for interaction analyses on risk of MI. RESULTS: The FGG 9340T &gt; C and FGA 2224G &gt; A polymorphisms, total plasma concentrations of fibrinogen, insulin and high-density lipoprotein, and gender appeared to be independent determinants of plasma fibrinogen gamma' concentration in patients, and the corresponding determinants in controls included FGG 9340T &gt; C and FGA 2224G &gt; A polymorphisms and plasma fibrinogen concentration. An elevated plasma fibrinogen gamma' concentration proved to be an independent predictor of MI [adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% CI): 1.24 (1.01, 1.52)]. The plasma fibrinogen gamma' concentration was involved in a high-order interaction with total plasma fibrinogen and the FGG 9340T &gt; C and FGA 2224G &gt; A polymorphisms, associated with a further increased risk of MI [OR (95% CI): 3.22 (2.35, 4.39)]. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma fibrinogen gamma' concentration influences the risk of MI, and this relationship seems to be strengthened by the presence of an elevated total plasma fibrinogen concentration and the FGG 9340T and FGA 2224G alleles.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="818" length="9"></location><text>1038G &gt; A</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="724" length="9"></location><text>9340T &gt; C</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="770" length="9"></location><text>2224G &gt; A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1800791</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2070011</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1049636</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18064451</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>IL4 in the 5q31 context: association studies of type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis in the Spanish population.		IL4, the gene coding the prototypic Th2 cytokine, has been frequently studied in the context of several inflammatory conditions, but conclusive results have not been obtained. This gene is located in the 5q31-33 complex genetic region, which shows some susceptibility factors to type 1 diabetes (T1D) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) among other inflammatory conditions. Our aim was to assess the involvement on T1D and RA of IL4 polymorphisms considered individually and in combination with other polymorphisms in 5q31-33, specifically in the OCTN locus, where the L503F polymorphism has been associated with Crohn's disease and other Th1 diseases. We performed a case-control study including 316 T1D patients, 599 RA patients and 540 healthy controls, all of them corresponding to white Spanish individuals. The IL4 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) -590C/T (rs2243250) and the OCTN1 exonic SNP L503F (rs1050152) were analysed in all samples. Frequency comparisons of -590C/T and stratified analysis including both cited SNPs were performed using chi-square tests. The -590C/T IL4 SNP was not found associated with T1D or RA when individual analyses were performed. However, a significant association with T1D emerged after stratification by L503F [p=0.02, odds ratio=1.95, 95% CI=1.07-3.55]. The location of the IL4 gene in the complex 5q31-33 genetic region, which contains many genes involved in immunological responses and presents linkage disequilibrium extended along many kilobases, makes necessary to interpret cautiously the previous IL4-association studies.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="971" length="7"></location><text>-590C/T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="680" length="5"></location><text>L503F</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2243250</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1050152</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17380320</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genotype and allele frequencies of polymorphic CYP2E1 in the Turkish population.		Cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) gene shows genetic polymorphisms that vary markedly in frequency among different ethnic and racial groups. We studied the genotype distributions and allele frequencies of three CYP2E1 polymorphisms: CYP2E1*5B (RsaI/PstI RFLP, C-1053T/G-1293C SNP, rs2031920 /rs3813867), CYP2E1*6 (DraI RFLP, T7632A SNP, rs6413432), and CYP2E1*7B (DdeI RFLP, G-71T SNP, rs6413420) by PCR/RFLP technique in a sample of 206 healthy subjects representing Turkish population. CYP2E1*5B polymorphism analysis yielded the genotype distribution as 96.12% for *1A/*1A (c1/c1), and 3.88% for *1A/*5B (c1/c2). The genotype frequencies for CYP2E1*6 polymorphism were found as 83.98% for *1A/*1A (T/T), 15.53% for *1A/*6 (T/A) and 0.49% for *6/*6 (A/A). For CYP2E1*7B (G-71T) polymorphism, the genotype frequencies were determined to be 86.89% for *1A/*1A (G/G), 12.62% for *1A/*7B (G/T) and 0.49% for *7B/*7B (T/T). Accordingly, the allele frequencies for *5B, *6 and *7B were 1.94, 8.25, and 6.80%, respectively. The genotype distributions of CYP2E1*5B and *6 in Turkish population were similar to those in other Caucasian populations, while differed significantly from East Asian populations. Recently, a novel and functionally important CYP2E1*7B polymorphism was identified in the promoter region. There have been few studies and limited data on CYP2E1*7B polymorphism frequency in the world and, so far, no information has been available for Turkish population. The genotype frequencies of CYP2E1*7B in Turkish population were found to be similar to those of other Caucasian populations. Population studies like this could be useful in assessing the susceptibility of different populations to chemical-induced diseases, including several types of cancer.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="401" length="6"></location><text>T7632A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6413432</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15670788</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>SNPs and haplotypes in the S100B gene reveal association with schizophrenia.		The S100B gene locates in 21q22.3 and produces neurotrophin mainly in astrocytes of CNS which can act as an extensive marker of glial cell integrity. The synaptic destabilization hypothesis (GGF/SD) suggests that the functional deficiency of growth factors like S100B is involved in the etiology of schizophrenia and the S100B serum concentration is reported to be significantly increased in patients with acute schizophrenia and decreased in chronic schizophrenia patients. To validate the association between S100B and schizophrenia, 384 cases and 401 controls, all Chinese Han subjects, were recruited. Four SNPs V1 (-960C&gt;G), V2 (-111C&gt;T), V3 (2757C&gt;G, rs1051169), and V4 (5748C&gt;T, rs9722) were studied. And haplotype V3-V4 (G-C) showed a significant association with schizophrenia. Our study showed an association between schizophrenia and a possible susceptible haplotype V3-V4 (G-C) which possesses a genetic tendency for increased S100B expression. Our results suggest that S100B could be a susceptible gene for schizophrenia and provide indirect evidence for the GGF/SD hypothesis.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="726" length="7"></location><text>2757C&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="755" length="7"></location><text>5748C&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1051169</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs9722</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16786032</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Impact of complex genetic variation in COMT on human brain function.		Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) has been shown to be critical for prefrontal dopamine flux, prefrontal cortex-dependent cognition and activation. Several potentially functional variants in the gene have been identified, but considerable controversy exists regarding the contribution of individual alleles and haplotypes to risk for schizophrenia, partly because clinical phenotypes are ill-defined and preclinical studies are limited by lack of adequate models. Here, we propose a neuroimaging approach to overcome these limitations by characterizing the functional impact of ambiguous haplotypes on a neural system-level intermediate phenotype in humans. Studying 126 healthy control subjects during a working-memory paradigm, we find that a previously described risk variant in a functional Val158Met (rs4680) polymorphism interacts with a P2 promoter region SNP (rs2097603) and an SNP in the 3' region (rs165599) in predicting inefficient prefrontal working memory response. We report evidence that the nonlinear response of prefrontal neurons to dopaminergic stimulation is a neural mechanism underlying these nonadditive genetic effects. This work provides an in vivo approach to functional validation in brain of the biological impact of complex genetic variations within a gene that may be critical for its clinical association.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="867" length="9"></location><text>Val158Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4680</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17697822</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Usefulness of combining complement factor H and C-reactive protein genetic profiles for predicting myocardial infarction (from the Rotterdam Study).		Complement factor H (CFH) is an important regulator of the complement cascade. Binding of C-reactive protein (CRP) to CFH augments the ability of CFH to downregulate the effect of complement in atherosclerotic lesions. The CFH Tyr402His polymorphism has been suggested to influence the ability of CFH to bind CRP. We hypothesized that the combined presence of unfavorable CRP and CFH genetic profiles is associated with risk of myocardial infarction (MI). The Rotterdam Study is a population-based cohort study in 7,983 men and women aged &gt; or =55 years. The CFH Tyr402His (rs1061170) polymorphism was determined (His(402) allele 37%), and using 3 tagging polymorphisms (rs1130864, rs1205, and rs3093068), CRP haplotypes were inferred (1 = CTC, 2 = TCC, 3 = CCC, 4 = CCG; frequencies of 33%, 32%, 30%, and 6%, respectively). Participants were grouped by CFH genotype (TyrTyr [reference], TyrHis, and HisHis) and CRP haplotype (haplotype 1 homozygotes [reference], haplotype 2 carriers, haplotype 3 carriers, and haplotype 4 carriers), which resulted in a total of 12 groups. CFH His(402) homozygotes who were also CRP haplotype 3 carriers had an age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratio of 5.9 (95% confidence interval 2.1 to 16.5) to develop MI compared with the reference group. In conclusion, this population-based study suggests that the combined presence of unfavorable CFH and CRP genetic profiles is associated with risk of MI.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="377" length="9"></location><text>Tyr402His</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1061170</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17510949</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A novel intronic polymorphism of ABCA1 gene reveals risk for sporadic Alzheimer's disease in Chinese.		Recent genetic studies have shown that variants of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1, ABCA1, may be implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this case-control study, a panel of 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) (including three amino-acid-coding SNPs used for replication of previous work, and 16 newly selected intronic tag SNPs) was genotyped. Nominally significant single marker P-values were observed in four SNPs, with the highest score of 0.003 for rs2297404 (OR = 1.88, 95%CI 1.23-2.87). In addition, six distinct linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks were detected. LD block1 harbored three nominally significant SNPs (rs2297404, rs2230808, and rs2020927), and showed a different haplotype structure in the affected and unaffected groups. Of the four haplotypes identified, haplotype2 (CAC) was more prevalent in the disease group (0.323 in AD vs. 0.202 in control); while haplotype1 (TGG) was over-represented in the healthy controls (0.595 in control vs. 0.493 in AD), indicating disease risk conferring possibility of haplotype2. After doubling the sample size, the three nominally significant SNPs were still significantly associated with AD. Although coding SNP (rs2230808) was confirmed to have a significant association with AD, prediction of the effects of an amino acid substitution SNP rs2230808 (R1587K) on the three-dimensional structure and function of the ABCA1 protein using PolyPhen program revealed that it is unlikely to be functionally significant. However, the adjacent rs2297404 in the same LD block is potentially functionally significant because of its position in the immediate vicinity of a splicing branch site. Further functional analysis of this polymorphism should be a high priority.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1450" length="6"></location><text>R1587K</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2230808</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16336637</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic analysis of the GLUT10 glucose transporter (SLC2A10) polymorphisms in Caucasian American type 2 diabetes.		BACKGROUND: GLUT10 (gene symbol SLC2A10) is a facilitative glucose transporter within the type 2 diabetes (T2DM)-linked region on chromosome 20q12-13.1. Therefore, we evaluated GLUT10 as a positional candidate gene for T2DM in Caucasian Americans. METHODS: Twenty SNPs including 4 coding, 10 intronic and 6 5' and 3' to the coding sequence were genotyped across a 100 kb region containing the SLC2A10 gene in DNAs from 300 T2DM cases and 310 controls using the Sequenom MassArray Genotyping System. Allelic association was evaluated, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) and haplotype structure of SLC2A10 were also determined to assess whether any specific haplotypes were associated with T2DM. RESULTS: Of these variants, fifteen had heterozygosities greater than 0.80 and were analyzed further for association with T2DM. No evidence of significant association was observed for any variant with T2DM (all P &gt; or = 0.05), including Ala206Thr (rs2235491) which was previously reported to be associated with fasting insulin. Linkage disequilibrium analysis suggests that the SLC2A10 gene is contained in a single haplotype block of 14 kb. Haplotype association analysis with T2DM did not reveal any significant differences between haplotype frequencies in T2DM cases and controls. CONCLUSION: From our findings, we can conclude that sequence variants in or near GLUT10 are unlikely to contribute significantly to T2DM in Caucasian Americans.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1043" length="9"></location><text>Ala206Thr</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2235491</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17997036</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association study of polymorphisms between DISC1 and schizophrenia in a Korean population.

Several lines of evidence suggest that DISC1 may be involved in susceptibility to SCZ. In this study, we investigated whether genetic polymorphisms in the coding region of DISC1 were associated with several SCZ clinical phenotypes in a Korean population. To examine any association between DISC1 and SCZ, we genotyped three clinical single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs3738401, R264Q; rs3738402, L465L; rs821616, S704C) in the coding region of the DISC1 gene using the Illumina Sentrix Array Matrix chip and direct sequencing in 303 patients with SCZ and 300 healthy controls. Our case-control analysis showed that none of these SNPs was associated with SCZ. In further endophenotype stratification, however, we found a significant association between rs821616 and the poor concentration subgroup of SCZ, determined using the Operational Criteria Checklist (codominant model, p=0.015).

Evidence is increasing for a role of polymorphisms in maternal or fetal innate immune response genes in preterm birth. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are important receptors in the innate immunity. The genotype distribution of two TLR2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one TLR4 SNP were determined among 524 neonates and associated with gestational age (GA). Genomic DNA was isolated from prospectively collected blood samples and polymorphisms in TLR2 (T-16934A, RS4696480 and Arg753Gln, RS5743708) and TLR4 (Thr399Ile, RS4986791) were determined using sequence specific primers by PCR. Allele frequencies of two TLR2 SNPs and one TLR4 SNP were analyzed according to prematurity. Analysis among 305 infants, after exclusion of infants born after multiple pregnancy or because of preeclampsia, revealed significantly shorter GAs for infants carrying two polymorphic TLR2 alleles (-16934TA/AA and 753ArgGln/GlnGln) compared with infants carrying one polymorphic and one wild-type allele or two wild-type alleles (median GA 30.6 wk versus 34.1-36.8 wk, respectively, p &lt; 0.02). Carriage of two variant TLR2 alleles potentially leads to aberrant innate immune responses, which may have contributed to very preterm birth.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="553" length="9"></location><text>Arg753Gln</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="585" length="9"></location><text>Thr399Ile</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="529" length="8"></location><text>T-16934A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5743708</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4696480</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4986791</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18368697</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>SCN5A variants in Japanese patients with left ventricular  noncompaction and arrhythmia.		Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a genetically heterogenous disorder. Mutations in the human cardiac sodium channel alpha-subunit gene (SCN5A) are involved in the pathophysiology of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies. This study was performed to compare the frequency of SCN5A variants in LVNC patients with or without arrhythmias, and to investigate the relationship between variants and disease severity. DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood of 62 Japanese probands with LVNC, comprising 17 familial cases and 45 sporadic cases. Blood samples were screened for variants in SCN5A using single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP) and DNA sequencing. Seven variants, rs6599230:G &gt; A, c.453C &gt; T, c.1141-3C &gt; A, rs1805124:A &gt; G (p.H558R), rs1805125:C &gt; T (p.P1090L), c.3996C &gt; T, and rs1805126:T &gt; C were identified in 7 familial and 12 sporadic cases. The frequency of SCN5A variants was significantly higher in the patients with arrhythmias than those without (50% vs 7%: P = 0.0003), suggesting these variants represent a risk factor for arrhythmia and supporting the hypothesis that genes encoding ion channels are involved in LVNC pathophysiology. The LVNC patients with heart failure also had high occurrence of SCN5A variants, suggesting the presence of SCN5A variants and/or arrhythmias increase the severity of LVNC.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="852" length="7"></location><text>p.H558R</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="879" length="8"></location><text>p.P1090L</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1805124</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1805125</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17634448</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Complement C3 variant and the risk of age-related macular degeneration.		BACKGROUND: Age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of blindness in Western populations. Susceptibility is influenced by age and by genetic and environmental factors. Complement activation is implicated in the pathogenesis. METHODS: We tested for an association between age-related macular degeneration and 13 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning the complement genes C3 and C5 in case subjects and control subjects from the southeastern region of England. All subjects were examined by an ophthalmologist and had independent grading of fundus photographs to confirm their disease status. To test for replication of the most significant findings, we genotyped a set of Scottish cases and controls. RESULTS: The common functional polymorphism rs2230199 (Arg80Gly) in the C3 gene, corresponding to the electrophoretic variants C3S (slow) and C3F (fast), was strongly associated with age-related macular degeneration in both the English group (603 cases and 350 controls, P=5.9x10(-5)) and the Scottish group (244 cases and 351 controls, P=5.0x10(-5)). The odds ratio for age-related macular degeneration in C3 S/F heterozygotes as compared with S/S homozygotes was 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 2.1); for F/F homozygotes, the odds ratio was 2.6 (95% CI, 1.6 to 4.1). The estimated population attributable risk for C3F was 22%. CONCLUSIONS: Complement C3 is important in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration. This finding further underscores the influence of the complement pathway in the pathogenesis of this disease.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="855" length="8"></location><text>Arg80Gly</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2230199</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18385794</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of novel mutations and sequence variants in the SOX2 and CHX10 genes in patients with anophthalmia/microphthalmia.		PURPOSE: Mutations in the SOX2 and CHX10 genes have been reported in patients with anophthalmia and/or microphthalmia. In this study, we evaluated 34 anophthalmic/microphthalmic patient DNA samples (two sets of siblings included) for mutations and sequence variants in SOX2 and CHX10. METHODS: Conformational sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) was used for the initial SOX2 and CHX10 screening of 34 affected individuals (two sets of siblings), five unaffected family members, and 80 healthy controls. Patient samples containing heteroduplexes were selected for sequence analysis. Base pair changes in SOX2 and CHX10 were confirmed by sequencing bidirectionally in patient samples. RESULTS: Two novel heterozygous mutations and two sequence variants (one known) in SOX2 were identified in this cohort. Mutation c.310 G&gt;T (p. Glu104X), found in one patient, was in the region encoding the high mobility group (HMG) DNA-binding domain and resulted in a change from glutamic acid to a stop codon. The second mutation, noted in two affected siblings, was a single nucleotide deletion c.549delC (p. Pro184ArgfsX19) in the region encoding the activation domain, resulting in a frameshift and premature termination of the coding sequence. The shortened protein products may result in the loss of function. In addition, a novel nucleotide substitution c.*557G&gt;A was identified in the 3'-untranslated region in one patient. The relationship between the nucleotide change and the protein function is indeterminate. A known single nucleotide polymorphism (c. *469 C&gt;A, SNP rs11915160) was also detected in 2 of the 34 patients. Screening of CHX10 identified two synonymous sequence variants, c.471 C&gt;T (p.Ser157Ser, rs35435463) and c.579 G&gt;A (p. Gln193Gln, novel SNP), and one non-synonymous sequence variant, c.871 G&gt;A (p. Asp291Asn, novel SNP). The non-synonymous polymorphism was also present in healthy controls, suggesting non-causality. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the role of SOX2 in ocular development. Loss of SOX2 function results in severe eye malformation. CHX10 was not implicated with microphthalmia/anophthalmia in our patient cohort.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1678" length="11"></location><text>c. *469 C&gt;A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1814" length="9"></location><text>c.471 C&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11915160</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs35435463</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17216277</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>PPARGC1A coding variation may initiate impaired NEFA clearance during glucose challenge.		AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha protein, encoded by the PPARGC1A gene, transcriptionally activates a complex pathway of lipid and glucose metabolism and is expressed primarily in tissues of high metabolic activity such as liver, heart and exercising oxidative skeletal muscle fibre. Ppargc1a-null mice develop systemic dyslipidaemia and hepatic steatosis. In humans, NEFAs downregulate PPARGC1A expression in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, a common non-synonymous coding variant at PPARGC1A (Gly482Ser, rs8192678) is associated with decreased PPARGC1A mRNA levels and increased type 2 diabetes risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a population-based sample of 691 healthy middle-aged Europids we assessed whether Gly482Ser is associated with levels of NEFA when fasting and in response to an oral glucose challenge. We also assessed the potential effect-modifying role of adipose tissue mass on these phenotypes. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, sex, fat mass and fat-free mass, the Ser482 allele associated with higher NEFA at 30 min and 2 h and with NEFA AUC (all values p&lt;or=0.02). Furthermore, suggestive evidence of interaction between fat mass and Gly482Ser was observed for fasting NEFA (p=0.059). After stratification by level of obesity, genotype associations were observed in the obese for fasting NEFA (p=0.028) and NEFA at 30 min (p=0.013) and 2 h (p=0.002), and with NEFA AUC (p=0.005), but no significant associations were observed in lean individuals (all values p&gt;0.6). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our observations indicate that NEFA clearance is blunted following a glucose load in carriers of the PPARCG1A Ser482 allele. This association is augmented by obesity.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="639" length="9"></location><text>Gly482Ser</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs8192678</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17657167</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Lack of association between the BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism and Alzheimer disease in a Chinese Han population.		Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by excessive neuronal loss in specific regions of the brain. Among the areas most severely affected are the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and their projection regions, the hippocampus and the cortex. Several lines of evidence have made brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) an important candidate gene conferring risk for AD. Recently, several reports investigated the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (Val66Met, rs6265) of the BDNF gene and AD but yielded ambiguous results. To figure out the association of this single nucleotide polymorphism in the BDNF gene with sporadic AD in a Chinese Han population, we analyzed 513 patients with AD and 575 controls for the genetic association studies. Our results indicated that the distribution of the BDNF genotypes and alleles did not differ significantly. Similar results were observed when the AD and control groups were stratified by age/age at onset and sex. Our data also showed that in the Chinese Han population, the frequencies of the BDNF Met allele (46.5%) and Val allele (53.5%) were significantly different from ethnic groups from Italy, Japan and the USA. The present data revealed no significant effect of the genotypes on the age at onset for developing AD, and no significant association between the genotypes and the severity of the disease.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="42" length="8"></location><text>Val66Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6265</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18281469</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Mutational analysis of thirty-two double-strand DNA break repair genes in breast and pancreatic cancers.		Inactivating mutations in several genes that encode components of the DNA repair machinery have been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. To assess whether alterations in other DNA repair genes contribute to breast cancer and to further determine the relevance of these genes to pancreatic cancer, we performed mutational analysis of 32 DNA double-strand break repair genes in genomic DNA from 38 breast tumors, 48 pancreatic tumors, and 10 non-BRCA1/BRCA2 hereditary breast cancer patients. A total of 494 coding exons were screened by denatured high-performance liquid chromatography and direct DNA sequencing. Two inactivating mutations were identified in breast tumor samples, a germline single-nucleotide deletion in POLQ (c.3605delT) and a somatic nonsense change in PRKDC (c.2408C&gt;A, p.Ser803X). Two germline-inactivating mutations in RAD50 (c.1875C&gt;G, p.Tyr625X and IVS14+1G&gt;A) were also detected in separate pancreatic tumor samples. In addition, 35 novel nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions, resulting from two in-frame deletions and 33 single nucleotide alterations, were identified. Seven of these were predicted to influence protein function. A separate analysis of the CLSPN c.3839C&gt;T (rs35490896) variant that was observed more frequently in breast tumors than in pancreatic tumors or normal controls failed to detect a significant association with breast cancer risk in a Mayo Clinic breast cancer case-control study. In conclusion, this screen of DNA repair genes implicates PRKDC and POLQ as candidate tumor suppressor genes involved in breast cancer and suggests that inactivating mutations in RAD50 predispose to pancreatic cancer as well as breast cancer.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1313" length="9"></location><text>c.3839C&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs35490896</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18239642</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Modifying effects of IL-6 polymorphisms on body size-associated breast cancer risk.		OBJECTIVE: The association between obesity and breast cancer risk is complex. We examined whether the association between body size and breast cancer risk is modified by interleukin-6 (IL6) genotype. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Five polymorphisms in the IL-6 gene (rs1800797/-596A&gt;G, rs1800796/-572G&gt;C, rs1800795/-174G&gt;C, rs2069832/IVS2G&gt;A, and rs2069849 exon 5 C&gt;T) were studied. We investigated IL6 genotypes and haplotypes with indicators of body size among non-Hispanic white (NHW) and Hispanic/American Indian (AI) breast cancer cases and controls living in the Southwestern United States. RESULTS: We observed lower mean levels of BMI among NHW women who carried one or two copies of the GGCAC haplotype (in order: rs1800797, rs1800796, rs1800795, rs2069832, and rs2069849; P trend 0.02). This haplotype, with an estimated frequency of 43% in NHW study controls, was considerably less common in Hispanic/AI controls (19%). We did not detect significant interactions between IL6 genotypes or haplotypes and BMI categorized as low/normal (&lt;25), overweight (25 to &lt;30), or obese (&gt; or =30) and breast cancer risk in either NHW or Hispanic/AI women. However, we detected consistent and significant interactions between waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and IL6 rs1800795/-174 G&gt;C genotype for breast cancer risk. These associations were restricted to postmenopausal NHW women. Among women without recent hormone exposure, those with a WHR &gt;0.9 and the rs1800795 GG genotype had a greater than threefold increased risk of breast cancer (odds ratios (ORs) 3.22, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) 1.27, 817) when compared with women with a WHR &lt;0.8 and the rs1800795 GG genotype (P interaction 0.01).

CONTEXT: Very recently the unforeseen role of syndecan 3 (SDC3), a family of membrane-bound heparin sulfate proteoglycans, in the regulation of energy balance has been discovered in the Sdc3 null female mice. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SDC3 are associated with obesity in the Korean population. DESIGN/SETTING/SUBJECTS: We conducted a population-based cohort study consisting of 229 control and 245 study subjects and a second independent study consisting of 192 control and 115 study subjects. Main Outcome Measurement: Body mass index (BMI) was measured. RESULTS: First, Sdc3 mRNA expression in the brain of ob/ob mice was profoundly increased, compared with control mice. Next, all three nonsynonymous SNPs [T271I (rs2282440, C&gt;T), D245N (rs4949184, C&gt;T), and V150I (rs2491132, C&gt;T)] in the SDC3 gene in control female subjects (BMI &lt; 23, n = 229) and obese female subjects (BMI &gt; 30, n = 245) were genotyped. We demonstrated the presence of clear ethnic differences in three nonsynonymous SDC3 SNPs among African-Americans, Chinese, Europeans, and Koreans. Of three SNPs in SDC3, rs4949184 was not associated with obesity and the other two SNPs (rs2282440 and rs2491132) were strongly associated with obesity (P &lt; 0.0001), and the results were confirmed in the second independent study group. Haplotype analysis also revealed strong association with obesity (chi2 = 76.92, P &lt; 0.000001). CONCLUSIONS: There are ethnic differences in the SDC3 polymorphisms, and the polymorphisms are strongly associated with obesity.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="930" length="5"></location><text>D245N</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="958" length="5"></location><text>V150I</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="906" length="5"></location><text>T271I</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4949184</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2282440</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2491132</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17358008</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Promoter polymorphisms in the MATP (SLC45A2) gene are associated with normal human skin color variation.		Human pigmentation is a complex physical trait in which the membrane-associated transporter protein (MATP) plays an important role as it is involved in intracellular processing and trafficking of melanosomal proteins. Recently, pathogenic mutations in MATP have been shown to cause oculocutaneous albinism type 4, while other polymorphisms are known to have a role in normal pigmentation variation. We previously reported significant associations of two coding region polymorphisms with hair, skin, and eye color in Caucasians. Here we characterize the promoter region of MATP identifying two new transcription start sites and a novel duplication (c.-1176_-1174dupAAT). A total of 700 individuals from five different population groups (529 Caucasians, 38 Asians, 46 African Americans, 47 Australian Aborigines, and 40 Spanish Basques) were genotyped for known promoter polymorphisms c.-1721C&gt;G (rs13289) and c.-1169G&gt;A (rs6867641), as well as c.-1176_-1174dupAAT. Allele frequencies of all three polymorphisms were significantly different between population groups. In Caucasians, the -1721G, +dup, and -1169A alleles were significantly associated with olive skin color. The three promoter polymorphisms were found to be in linkage disequilibrium with each other but not with the two previously reported coding region polymorphisms. Functional analyses in a melanoma cell line showed that the promoter haplotype -1721G, +dup, -1169A significantly decreased MATP transcription. This report provides further evidence for the involvement of MATP in normal pigmentation variation by identifying associations between MATP alleles and skin color variation in Caucasians and demonstrating a functional significance of these polymorphisms.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1014" length="10"></location><text>c.-1169G&gt;A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="989" length="10"></location><text>c.-1721C&gt;G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6867641</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs13289</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16023289</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic influences on oxidative stress and their association with normal cognitive ageing.		Oxidative stress is hypothesised to play a major role in ageing processes. Reactive oxygen species produced during normal aerobic metabolism damage cellular macromolecules. The brain is particularly susceptible to oxidative stress due to its high rate of aerobic metabolism. We hypothesised that polymorphisms in genes contributing to antioxidant defences are associated with variation in normal cognitive ageing in the absence of dementia. We examined associations between two SNPs (rs2073495 and rs743658) in Lactotransferrin (LTF), a gene involved in iron absorption, and the common M129V SNP in the prion protein gene, PRNP (rs1799990), with cognitive ability and cognitive ageing in a cohort of non-demented individuals born in 1921. All had cognitive ability measured at age 11 in the Scottish Mental Survey of 1932, and again at age 79. No association was identified with LTF. PRNP M129V was significantly related to Moray House Test (MHT) IQ scores at age 79, adjusted for sex and age 11 IQ (p=0.006). Individuals homozygous for the methionine allele performed significantly better than heterozygotes. This study supports the hypothesis that genetic variations in antioxidant defence genes, specifically PRNP, are important influences on the trajectory of normal cognitive ageing. An interaction between PRNP and klotho (KL) genotypes was also identified (p=0.015), highlighting the importance of analysing gene interactions when investigating associations with quantitative traits.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="678" length="5"></location><text>M129V</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1799990</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17630229</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Norepinephrine transporter polymorphisms T-182C and G1287A are not associated with alcohol dependence and its clinical subgroups.		Several studies have suggested that the norepinephrine transporter (NET) may play an important role in the pathogenesis of alcohol dependence. Additional studies have shown that the polymorphisms of T-182C (rs2242446) and G1287A (rs5569) in NET gene (hSLC6A2) may affect the NET function. Therefore, in this study, we examined whether these hSLC6A2 gene polymorphisms are a susceptibility factor for alcohol dependence or its clinical subgroup(s). A total of 690 Han Chinese subjects (408 alcohol dependent patients and 282 controls) in Taiwan were recruited for this study. Individuals with alcohol dependence were classified into several clinical subgroups to reduce the clinical heterogeneity. All subjects were interviewed with identical methods, and the mental disorders were diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria. The polymorphisms of T-182C and G1287A in hSLC6A2 gene were analyzed by using a standard method. No significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies of hSLC6A2 polymorphisms were found between controls and total alcohol dependence or between more homogeneous subgroups with alcohol dependence and controls. This study suggests that the polymorphisms of T-182C and G1287A in hSLC6A2 gene are not major risk factors in increasing susceptibility to either alcohol dependence or its clinical subtypes.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="52" length="6"></location><text>G1287A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="41" length="6"></location><text>T-182C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5569</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2242446</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18162085</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>The ATG16L1 gene variants rs2241879 and rs2241880 (T300A) are strongly associated with susceptibility to Crohn's disease in the German population.		OBJECTIVES: We analyzed ATG16L1, a recently identified Crohn's disease (CD) susceptibility gene, in a large cohort with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including potential interactions with other IBD genes as well as factors regulating its gene expression. METHODS: Genomic DNA from 2,890 Caucasians including 768 patients with CD, 507 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 1,615 healthy controls was analyzed for 9 different ATG16L1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genotyping included CARD15/NOD2 variants p.Arg702Trp, p.Gly908Arg, and p.Leu1007fsX1008 and polymorphisms in SLC22A4/OCTN1 (1672 C--&gt;T) and SLC22A5/OCTN2 (-207 G--&gt;C) as well as 10 CD-associated IL23R variants. The transcriptional regulation of ATG16L1 was studied in intestinal epithelial cells following stimulation with Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and proinflammatory cytokines and in a murine ileitis model and CD biopsies. RESULTS: All nine ATG16L1 gene variants analyzed displayed highly significant associations with CD demonstrating a CD-protective effect for the minor allele. The strongest associations were found for rs2241879 and the coding SNP rs2241880 (T300A); P= 3.6 x 10(-6) and 3.7 x 10(-6), respectively (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.65-0.84 for both variants). The genotype-phenotype analysis revealed no significant associations. In UC, only rs6431660 was weakly disease-associated. There was no evidence for epistasis between the ATG16L1 gene and other susceptibility genes (IL23R, CARD15, SLC22A4/5). ATG16L1 mRNA expression was not upregulated in CD and murine ileitis, and was less than threefold increased in cells stimulated with proinflammatory cytokines and TLR ligands. CONCLUSION: ATG16L1 is a CD susceptibility gene without epistatic interaction with other CD susceptibility genes and is not upregulated in intestinal inflammation.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="51" length="5"></location><text>T300A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2241880</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18061132</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Phenotype analysis of patients with the risk variant LOC387715 (A69S) in age-related macular degeneration.		PURPOSE: To examine phenotypes of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients with the LOC387715 variant (T allele at rs10490924, A69S). DESIGN: Retrospective, observational case series. METHODS: This clinic-based case series data set contained 775 unrelated cases of AMD. AMD phenotypes of three groups, determined by the number of LOC387715 risk alleles, were compared regarding the presence or absence of 16 phenotypic features. RESULTS: The number of AMD cases in each group was 164 cases (two risk alleles), 330 cases (one risk allele), and 281 cases (zero risk allele). The mean age at examination for homozygous carriers of the LOC387715 risk allele was significantly lower (73.9 years) than the age for carriers of one (76.4 years) or no (77.1 years) risk allele (P = .0003). Of the 16 features analyzed, only AMD grade (P = .00002) was significantly associated with the LOC387715 variant. As the number of LOC387715 risk alleles increased, the proportion of grade 5 AMD cases increased in a dose-response fashion. CONCLUSIONS: The LOC387715 variant appears to be an independent risk factor for grade 5 (neovascular) AMD. This variant may also be associated with an earlier onset of AMD. Phenotypes that suggest a high-risk genotype may prove valuable for diagnostic, therapeutic, and research purposes.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="64" length="4"></location><text>A69S</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs10490924</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17636279</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A polymorphism in the AMH type II receptor gene is associated with age at menopause in interaction with parity.		BACKGROUND: Anti-M端llerian hormone (AMH) inhibits primordial follicle recruitment in the mouse ovary. We hypothesize that in women AMH signaling also regulates the usage of the primordial follicle pool and hence influences the onset of menopause. Since age at menopause has a strong genetic component, we investigated the role of AMH signaling using a candidate gene approach. METHODS: In two large population-based cohorts of Dutch post-menopausal women (n = 2381 and n = 248), we examined the association between two polymorphisms, one in the AMH gene and one in the AMH type II receptor (AMHR2) gene, and natural age at menopause. RESULTS: The AMH Ile(49)Ser polymorphism (rs10407022) was not associated with age at menopause in either cohort. In the Rotterdam cohort, the AMHR2 -482 A &gt; G polymorphism (rs2002555) was associated with age at menopause in interaction with the number of offspring (P = 0.001). Nulliparous women homozygous for the G-allele entered menopause 2.6 years earlier compared with nulliparous women homozygous for the A-allele (P = 0.005). In the LASA cohort, women with the G/G genotype tended to enter menopause 2.8 years earlier compared with the A/A genotype (P = 0.063). CONCLUSIONS: The observed association of the AMHR2 -482 A &gt; G polymorphism with natural age at menopause suggests a role for AMH signaling in the usage of the primordial follicle pool in women.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="895" length="11"></location><text>-482 A &gt; G </text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="764" length="10"></location><text>Ile(49)Ser</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2002555</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs10407022</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15268889</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Test of linkage and/or association between the estrogen receptor alpha gene with bone mineral density in Caucasian nuclear families.		Extensive studies have been performed on the association between the estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) gene and bone mineral density (BMD). Despite considerable efforts, the studies using limited markers and relatively small sample size have yielded largely inconsistent results. In this study, 1873 Caucasian subjects from 405 nuclear families containing 1512 sib pairs were recruited. BMD at the lumbar spine (LS) and femoral neck (FN) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning from exon 1 to 8 in the ER-alpha gene were genotyped. The program QTDT (quantitative transmission disequilibrium test) was applied to test linkage and/or association of the ER-alpha gene and BMD variation using individual SNP markers and reconstructed haplotypes. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was generally detected for SNPs in the ER-a gene (P &lt; 0.05). Associations were observed between SNP rs932477 and FN BMD (P = 0.028), and between the most predominant three-marker haplotype (GCG) containing SNP rs932477 and FN BMD (P = 0.010). Within-family association (present only with both linkage and association) between SNP rs2228480 (G2014A) and FN BMD (P = 0.015) was observed. The most predominant seven-SNP haplotype (TCGCGGG) was associated with higher LS BMD (P = 0.015). However, after correction for multiple testing, these associations did not reach statistical significance. Denser markers may be necessary to better define the relationship between the ER-alpha gene and BMD variation in our sample.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1316" length="6"></location><text>G2014A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2228480</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17374705</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of small ubiquitin-like modifier 4 (SUMO4) variant, located in IDDM5 locus, with type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population.		CONTEXT: Despite distinct differences in the pathogenesis, epidemiological data have indicated familial clustering of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, suggesting a common genetic basis between these two types of diabetes. Few shared susceptibility genes, however, have been reported to date. OBJECTIVE: Small ubiquitin-like modifier 4 (SUMO4) has been identified as a candidate gene for the IDDM5 locus and suggested to have possible involvement in immune responses, such as autoimmunity and inflammation. Recent reports demonstrated that a polymorphism with an amino acid substitution (Met55Val) in SUMO4 was associated with type 1 diabetes in Asian populations, although no association was reproduced in subjects of Caucasian descent. The present study aimed to clarify the contribution of SUMO4 to type 2 diabetes susceptibility in the Japanese population. SUBJECTS: The 753 subjects included 355 cases and 398 control subjects. METHODS: The SUMO4 Met55Val (rs237025) and 001Msp (rs577001) polymorphisms were genotyped. RESULTS: Strong linkage disequilibrium (D': 1.0 in each pair of single-nucleotide polymorphisms) across the MAP3K7IP2/SUMO4 region was shown in the Japanese population. The frequency of genotypes with the G allele of the SUMO4 Met55Val polymorphism was significantly higher in patients with type 2 diabetes [odds ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-1.93; P = 0.01, chi(2) test]. The association was concentrated in patients without insulin therapy (odds ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.13-2.15; P = 0.0072), but not in those with insulin (odds ratio, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.81-1.89; not significant). CONCLUSIONS: These data, together with previous reports, suggest the contribution of the SUMO4 Met55Val polymorphism to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes susceptibility in the Japanese population.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="720" length="8"></location><text>Met55Val</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs237025</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18035072</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Polymorphisms in hypoxia inducible factor 1 and the initial clinical presentation of coronary disease.		BACKGROUND: Only some patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) develop acute myocardial infarction (MI), and emerging evidence suggests vulnerability to MI varies systematically among patients and may have a genetic component. The goal of this study was to assess whether polymorphisms in genes encoding elements of pathways mediating the response to ischemia affect vulnerability to MI among patients with underlying CAD. METHODS: We prospectively identified patients at the time of their initial clinical presentation of CAD who had either an acute MI or stable exertional angina. We collected clinical data and genotyped 34 polymorphisms in 6 genes (ANGPT1, HIF1A, THBS1, VEGFA, VEGFC, VEGFR2). RESULTS: The 909 patients with acute MI were significantly more likely than the 466 patients with stable angina to be male, current smokers, and hypertensive, and less likely to be taking beta-blockers or statins. Three polymorphisms in HIF1A (Pro582Ser, rs11549465; rs1087314; and Thr418Ile, rs41508050) were significantly more common in patients who presented with stable exertional angina rather than acute MI, even after statistical adjustment for cardiac risk factors and medications. The HIF-mediated transcriptional activity was significantly lower when HIF1A null fibroblasts were transfected with variant HIF1A alleles than with wild-type HIF1A alleles. CONCLUSIONS: Polymorphisms in HIF1A were associated with development of stable exertional angina rather than acute MI as the initial clinical presentation of CAD.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1049" length="9"></location><text>Pro582Ser</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1087" length="9"></location><text>Thr418Ile</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11549465</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs41508050</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17065359</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Common variants in the ENPP1 gene are not reproducibly associated with diabetes or obesity.		The common missense single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) K121Q in the ectoenzyme nucleotide pyrophosphate phosphodiesterase (ENPP1) gene has recently been associated with type 2 diabetes in Italian, U.S., and South-Asian populations. A three-SNP haplotype, including K121Q, has also been associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes in French and Austrian populations. We set out to confirm these findings in several large samples. We genotyped the haplotype K121Q (rs1044498), rs1799774, and rs7754561 in 8,676 individuals of European ancestry with and without type 2 diabetes, in 1,900 obese and 930 lean individuals of European ancestry from the U.S. and Poland, and in 1,101 African-American individuals. Neither the K121Q missense polymorphism nor the putative risk haplotype were significantly associated with type 2 diabetes or BMI. Two SNPs showed suggestive evidence of association in a meta-analysis of our European ancestry samples. These SNPs were rs7754561 with type 2 diabetes (odds ratio for the G-allele, 0.85 [95% CI 0.78-0.92], P = 0.00003) and rs1799774 with BMI (homozygotes of the delT-allele, 0.6 [0.42-0.88], P = 0.007). However, these findings are not supported by other studies. We did not observe a reproducible association between these three ENPP1 variants and BMI or type 2 diabetes.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="813" length="5"></location><text>K121Q</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1044498</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17114643</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Up-regulation of DLK1 as an imprinted gene could contribute to human hepatocellular carcinoma.		Dysregulation of a genomic imprinting gene can contribute to carcinogenesis. Here, delta-like 1 homolog (Drosophila) (DLK1), a paternally expressed gene, was found to be significantly up-regulated in 60 (73.2%) of a total of 82 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In addition, immunohistochemistry staining was performed in another 88 HCC specimens, of which 50 (56.8%) cancerous tissues were considered as positive. The expression of DLK1 was obviously induced in HCC cells, Bel-7402 and MHCC-H, by a demethylation agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Furthermore, both demethylation of the DLK1 promoter (-565 to -362) and hypermethylation of the imprinting control domain in the region upstream of maternally expressed gene 3 were identified in a few HCC specimens. This implies that deregulation of genomic DNA methylation of the imprinted domain could be attributed to the up-regulation of DLK1 in HCC, although the undoubtedly complex mechanisms involved in the epigenetic event should be further investigated in HCC. Surprisingly, the expression of DLK1 in HCC was confirmed to be monoallelic specific, not biallelic, in three HCC specimens with a single nucleotide polymorphism as at T852C (rs2295660). Importantly, the exogenous DLK1 can significantly promote the cell proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells, a HCC cell line, whereas the suppression of endogenetic DLK1 through RNA interference can markedly inhibit cell growth, colony formation and tumorigenicity of HepG2, Hep3B and HuH-7 cells. These data suggest that DLK1 as an imprinted gene could be significantly up-regulated in HCC due to certain epigenetic events and contribute to the oncogenesis of this tumor.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1342" length="5"></location><text>T852C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2295660</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17762646</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A coding polymorphism of the kallikrein 1 gene is associated with essential hypertension: a tagging SNP-based association study in a Chinese Han population.		OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between common variants in the human tissue kallikrein 1 (KLK1) gene and susceptibility to essential hypertension in Chinese Han. METHODS: A tagging single nucleotide polymorphism (tSNP) approach was used for a case-control study in 2411 patients with essential hypertension and 2348 controls. All DNA samples and clinical data were collected from the International Collaborative Study of Cardiovascular Disease in Asia (InterASIA). RESULTS: Based on the HapMap data of Han Chinese in Beijing (CHB) population, two non-synonymous polymorphisms, namely rs5517 (Glu162Lys) and rs5516 (Gln121Glu), were selected as tSNPs which could efficiently tag eight SNPs of the KLK1 gene with R larger than 90% for both haplotypes and single locus. Significant differences were found between groups for frequencies of rs5517 A allele (42.48% in cases versus 39.32% in controls, P=0.0019) and AA genotype [adjusted odds ratio (OR)=1.25 for AA versus AG/GG, P=0.0067]. The haplotype composed of the rs5517 A and rs5516 G allele significantly increased the risk of hypertension, with adjusted OR of 1.12 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-1.28, P=0.0377] when compared with the common haplotype G-C. Diplotype analysis also showed a significant association between the diplotype of AG-AC and essential hypertension (OR=1.34, 95% CI, 1.07-1.68, P=0.0096). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested that rs5517 in the KLK1 gene was significantly associated with essential hypertension in a Chinese Han population.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="809" length="9"></location><text>Gln121Glu</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="786" length="9"></location><text>Glu162Lys</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5516</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5517</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16733712</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>ICAM gene cluster SNPs and prostate cancer risk in African Americans.		Intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) are known to be involved in various human cancers. An ICAM gene cluster lying within a 26 kb region on chromosome 19p13.2, and containing ICAM1, ICAM4, and ICAM5 has recently been identified as harboring a breast and prostate cancer susceptibility locus in two populations of European ancestry from Germany and Australia. The objective of this study was to confirm the ICAM association with prostate cancer in a sample of African American prostate cancer cases (N = 286) and controls (N = 391). Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the three ICAM genes were genotyped. To control for potential population stratification an ancestry-adjusted association analysis was performed. We found that ICAM1 SNPs, -9A/C (rs5490) and K469E (rs5498) were associated with prostate cancer risk in men with a family history of prostate cancer (P = 0.008). Specifically, increased risk was observed for individuals who possessed the CC genotype of the -9 A/C variant (odds ratio = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.0-6.3) and at least one G allele of non-synonymous K469E variant (odds ratio = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.2-3.1). Strong linkage disequilibrium was observed across the ICAM region (P &lt; 0.001). A common haplotype within the ICAM gene cluster, harboring the -9A/C variant was significantly associated with prostate cancer (P = 0.03), mainly due to men with family history (P = 0.01). Our results replicate previous findings of association of the ICAM gene cluster with prostate cancer and suggest that common genetic variation within ICAM1 and not ICAM5 may be an important risk factor for prostate cancer.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="828" length="5"></location><text>-9A/C</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="847" length="5"></location><text>K469E</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5490</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5498</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17624591</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic variation of TP53, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-related exposures, and breast cancer risk among women on Long Island, New York.		BACKGROUND: p53 participates in cell cycle control, programmed cell death/apoptosis, and DNA repair, all pathways involved in carcinogenesis. TP53 variants may influence p53 function. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated whether three well-characterized TP53 variants -- Ex4 + 119 C &gt; G (rs#1042522, Arg72Pro), IVS6 + 62 A &gt; G (rs#1625895), and an IVS3 16 bp insertion/ deletion (INDEL; rs#17878362) -- were associated with breast cancer risk in a population-based case-control study. METHODS: Genotypes and haplotypes were determined using long-range PCR in a sample of 578 cases and 390 controls. RESULTS: For the Ex4 + 19 C &gt; G SNP (rs1042522), women with the heterozygous genotype (G/C) had a 32% increase in breast cancer risk. Other variants were not associated with risk. We further examined whether these associations were modified by cigarette smoking status and detection of PAH-DNA adducts in circulating lymphocytes. Among current smokers, each copy of the minor alleles for the IVS6 + 62 A &gt; G SNP (rs1625895) and the IVS3 INDEL polymorphism (rs17878362) was associated with lower breast cancer risk (OR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.90; OR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.22-0.78, respectively). However, among former smokers, the homozygous variant genotype for these 2 SNPs was observed among cases (4.1 and 3.2%, respectively) and not controls. Genotype associations were not modified by the presence or absence of DNA adducts in circulating lymphocytes. Three-loci haplotypes were not significantly associated with breast cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: These results should be confirmed in larger studies, but suggest that cigarette smoking may influence breast cancer risk through interaction with p53.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="428" length="7"></location><text>Arg72Pr</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="439" length="15"></location><text>IVS6 + 62 A &gt; G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1042522</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1625895</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17325155</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>The LOC387715 polymorphism and age-related macular degeneration: replication in three case-control samples.		PURPOSE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multifactorial blinding disease in the elderly. LOC387715 harbors a single-nucleotide polymorphism that has an association with AMD. This study was conducted to confirm the association between LOC387715 and AMD and to refine estimates of the impact of this gene variation in using samples from three studies: an Australian population-based study and two U.S. clinic-based case-control studies. METHODS: Cases and controls were collected from a National Eye Institute (NEI) clinical protocol (n = 240), the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS; n = 488), and the Blue Mountains Eye Study (BMES; n = 851). After DNA extraction, subjects were genotyped for the LOC387715 Ala69Ser polymorphism (rs10490924). RESULTS: The combined NEI and AREDS samples yielded odds ratios (ORs) of 2.61 (95% CI 1.89-3.61, P = 1.42 x 10(-9)) and 8.59 (95% CI 4.49-16.5, P = 3.56 x 10(-13)) for the heterozygous and homozygous risk alleles, respectively. The corresponding odds ratios in the BMES sample were 1.69 (95% CI: 1.25-2.28, P = 0.0007) and 2.20 (95% CI: 1.05-4.62, P = 0.038) for the heterozygous and homozygous groups. Neither set of samples showed statistically significant interaction with smoking, although there appeared to be a trend of interaction between smoking and LOC387715 for risk of advanced AMD. CONCLUSIONS: Although these data from three case-control samples support an AMD genetic risk marker harbored within LOC387715, the nested case-control data from the population-based BMES samples showed lower estimates than from the clinic-based samples. This may be because the BMES samples consisted of largely early AMD cases while the clinic-based AMD samples consisted exclusively of advanced cases.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="830" length="8"></location><text>Ala69Ser</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs10490924</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17569884</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A polymorphism in the protease-like domain of apolipoprotein(a) is associated with severe coronary artery disease.		OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to identify genetic variants associated with severe coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS AND RESULTS: We used 3 case-control studies of white subjects whose severity of CAD was assessed by angiography. The first 2 studies were used to generate hypotheses that were then tested in the third study. We tested 12,077 putative functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Study 1 (781 cases, 603 controls) and identified 302 SNPs nominally associated with severe CAD. Testing these 302 SNPs in Study 2 (471 cases, 298 controls), we found 5 (in LPA, CALM1, HAP1, AP3B1, and ABCG2) were nominally associated with severe CAD and had the same risk alleles in both studies. We then tested these 5 SNPs in Study 3 (554 cases, 373 controls). We found 1 SNP that was associated with severe CAD: LPA I4399M (rs3798220). LPA encodes apolipoprotein(a), a component of lipoprotein(a). I4399M is located in the protease-like domain of apolipoprotein(a). Compared with noncarriers, carriers of the 4399M risk allele (2.7% of controls) had an adjusted odds ratio for severe CAD of 3.14 (confidence interval 1.51 to 6.56), and had 5-fold higher median plasma lipoprotein(a) levels (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The LPA I4399M SNP is associated with severe CAD and plasma lipoprotein(a) levels.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="955" length="6"></location><text>I4399M</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3798220</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18059035</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Leptin and leptin receptor genotypes and colon cancer: gene-gene and gene-lifestyle interactions.		Leptin may play an important role in colorectal cancer because of its role in energy balance, insulin and inflammation. We evaluated the LEP rs2167270 (19 G &gt; A) and rs7799039 (-2548 G &gt; A) polymorphisms and the leptin receptor, LEPR rs6588147 (located in intron 2), polymorphism with risk of developing colon cancer in a study of 1,567 cases and 1,965 controls. We evaluated the effects of the polymorphisms with body mass index (BMI), recent use of aspirin/NSAIDs and genetic variations in genes related to insulin signaling pathways including insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), and insulin-related substrates 1 and 2 (IRS1, IRS2) and the vitamin D receptor (VDR). We observed a slight reduction in colon cancer risk with the AA LEP rs2167270 genotype (OR 0.79 95% CI 0.64, 0.98) and although not reaching statistical significance, with the combined GG LEP rs2167270 and GG LEPR rs6588147 (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49, 1.02) genotypes. BMI did not interact with any of these polymorphisms to alter colon cancer risk. However, recent aspirin/NSAID use significantly interacted with both LEP polymorphisms. Likewise, variants of IGF1 and IRS2 interacted with the LEP rs2167270 polymorphism. VDR polymorphisms interacted with all LEP and LEPR polymorphisms. These data support an association between LEP and colon cancer. They also suggest that the mechanisms linking leptin to colon cancer may be independent of energy balance.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="251" length="8"></location><text>19 G &gt; A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="276" length="11"></location><text>-2548 G &gt; A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2167270</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs7799039</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17999208</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A cytoskeleton motor protein genetic variant may exert a protective effect on the occurrence of multiple sclerosis: the janus face of the kinesin light-chain 1 56836CC genetic variant.		Although the main pathomechanism of multiple sclerosis (MS) is not known, an autoimmune response is presumed to involve its evolution and propagation. In this study, we examined how the kinesin light-chain 1 (KLC1) G56836C (rs8702) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in intron 13 affects the occurrence of MS. This genetic variant was found to be associated with cognitive disturbances and neurodegeneration, and it was presumed to affect the kinesin function. Kinesin serves as a main cytoskeleton motor protein by carrying mitochondria and the molecular apparatus of myelin basic protein synthesis. The present association analysis of this genetic variant was performed in 102 relapsing-remitting MS patients and in 207 neuroimaging alteration-free controls. The KLC1 56836CC variant proved to exert a significant protective effect on the occurrence of MS (2.0% vs. 9.7%, P &lt; 0.02; crude OR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.04-0.82, P &lt; 0.05; adjusted OR: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.018-0.88, P &lt; 0.05).

Previous results from our genetic analyses using pedigrees from a French Canadian population suggested that the interval delimited by markers on chromosome 12, D12S86 and D12S378, was the most probable genomic region to contain a susceptibility gene for affective disorders. Association studies with microsatellite markers using a case/control sample from the same population (n = 427) revealed significant allelic associations between the bipolar phenotype and marker NBG6. Since this marker is located in intron 9 of the P2RX7 gene, we analyzed the surrounding genomic region for the presence of polymorphisms in regulatory, coding and intron/exon junction sequences. Twenty four (24) SNPs were genotyped in a case/control sample and 12 SNPs in all pedigrees used for linkage analysis. Allelic, genotypic or family-based association studies suggest the presence of two susceptibility loci, the P2RX7 and CaMKK2 genes. The strongest association was observed in bipolar families at the non-synonymous SNP P2RX7-E13A (rs2230912, P-value = 0.000708), which results from an over-transmission of the mutant G-allele to affected offspring. This Gln460Arg polymorphism occurs at an amino acid that is conserved between humans and rodents and is located in the C-terminal domain of the P2X7 receptor, known to be essential for normal P2RX7 function.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1300" length="9"></location><text>Gln460Arg</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2230912</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15645182</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of Ala72Ser polymorphism with COMT enzyme activity and the risk of schizophrenia in Koreans.		Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inactivates circulating catechol hormones, catechol neurotransmitters, and xenobiotic catecholamines by methylating their catechol moieties. The COMT gene has been suggested as a candidate gene for schizophrenia through linkage analyses and molecular studies of velo-cardio-facial syndrome. A coding polymorphism of the COMT gene at codon 108/158 (soluble/membrane-bound form) causing a valine to methionine substitution has been shown to influence enzyme activity, but its association with schizophrenia is inconclusive. We have screened 17 known polymorphisms of the COMT gene in 320 Korean schizophrenic patients and 379 controls to determine whether there is a positive association with a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs6267) at codon 22/72 (soluble/membrane-bound form) causing an alanine-to-serine (Ala/Ser) substitution. With the Ala/Ala genotype as a reference group, the combined genotype (Ala/Ser and Ser/Ser)-specific adjusted odds ratio was 1.82 (95% CI = 1.19-2.76; P = 0.005), suggesting the Ser allele as a risk allele for schizophrenia. However, the Val/Met polymorphism was not associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia in Koreans (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.64-1.21; P = 0.43). The Ala72Ser substitution was correlated with reduced COMT enzyme activity.

Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) is one of the enzymes that degrade catecholamine neurotransmitters including dopamine. The COMT gene is located on 22q11.2, a common susceptibility locus for schizophrenia. Therefore, COMT is a strong functional and positional candidate gene for schizophrenia. A common functional polymorphism (rs4680, Val158Met) has been extensively tested for an association with schizophrenia, but with conflicting results. Recent studies indicate that if COMT is implicated in susceptibility to schizophrenia, this cannot be wholly accounted for by the Val158Met polymorphism. To assess this view, the authors conducted a case-control association study (399 patients with schizophrenia and 440 control subjects) for five functional polymorphisms (rs2075507, rs737865, rs6267, rs4680 and rs165599) in Japanese subjects. There were no significant associations found between the polymorphisms or haplotypes of COMT and schizophrenia. The present study shows that these five functional COMT polymorphisms do not play a major role in conferring susceptibility to schizophrenia in Japanese.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="485" length="9"></location><text>Val158Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4680</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17549303</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Functional promoter polymorphism in the VKORC1 gene is no major genetic determinant for coronary heart disease in Northern Germans.		Recently, the C-allele of polymorphism rs2359612 (VKORC1: c.283+837C&gt;T) in the VKORC1 gene has been reported to represent a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and aortic dissection in Chinese patients. VKOR activity itself is the rate-limiting step in gamma-carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors (factors II, VII, IX, X, protein C, S, and Z) and proteins of calcium metabolism (matrix Gla protein and osteocalcin). Gamma-carboxylation is essential for the biological activity of these proteins that have been previously hypothesised to play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. It was the objective of this study to analyse the VKORC1 genotype frequency in patients with CHD and controls from Northern Germany and to investigate the association of VKORC1 and CHD risk in patients with an European background. CHD patients (n = 901) and healthy controls (n = 521) were part of the PopGen biobank. Case and control samples were matched for ethnic and geographic origin, age and gender. After typing German CHD patients and control individuals, no evidence for a statistically significant association was detected between VKORC1 genotype and CHD phenotype. Also stratification for gender and myocardial infarction yielded no significant results. In conclusion, the discrepant association findings in Chinese and German populations may be explained by ethnic differences in genetic and perhaps environmental predisposition, modifying the polygenic CHD phenotype by interacting with VKORC1 variants and thus conferring disease susceptibility in some populations, but not in others.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="191" length="12"></location><text>c.283+837C&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2359612</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18043751</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Admixture mapping provides evidence of association of the VNN1 gene with hypertension.		Migration patterns in modern societies have created the opportunity to use population admixture as a strategy to identify susceptibility genes. To implement this strategy, we genotyped a highly informative ancestry marker panel of 2270 single nucleotide polymorphisms in a random population sample of African Americans (N = 1743), European Americans (N = 1000) and Mexican Americans (N = 581). We then examined the evidence for over-transmission of specific loci to cases from one of the two ancestral populations. Hypertension cases and controls were defined based on standard clinical criteria. Both case-only and case-control analyses were performed among African Americans. With the genome-wide markers we replicated the findings identified in our previous admixture mapping study on chromosomes 6 and 21 [1]. For case-control analysis we then genotyped 51 missense SNPs in 36 genes spaced across an 18.3 Mb region. Further analyses demonstrated that the missense SNP rs2272996 (or N131S) in the VNN1 gene was significantly associated with hypertension in African Americans and the association was replicated in Mexican Americans; a non-significant opposite association was observed in European Americans. This SNP also accounted for most of the evidence observed in the admixture analysis on chromosome 6. Despite these encouraging results, susceptibility loci for hypertension have been exceptionally difficult to localize and confirmation by independent studies will be necessary to establish these findings.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1074" length="5"></location><text>N131S</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2272996</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17388729</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Identification of sex-specific associations between polymorphisms of the osteoprotegerin gene, TNFRSF11B, and Paget's disease of bone.		We studied the role of TNFRSF11B polymorphisms on the risk to develop Paget's disease of bone in a Belgian study population. We observed no association in men, but a highly significant association was found in women, and this was confirmed in a population from the United Kingdom. INTRODUCTION: Juvenile Paget's disease has been shown to be caused by mutations in TNFRSF11B encoding osteoprotegerin. Although mutations in this gene have never been found in patients with typical Paget's disease of bone (PDB), there are indications that polymorphisms in TNFRSF11B might contribute to the risk of developing PDB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We recruited a population of 131 Belgian patients with sporadic PDB and 171 Belgian controls. By means of the HapMap, we selected 17 SNPs that, in combination with four multimarker tests, contain most information on common genetic variation in TNFRSF11B. To replicate the findings observed in the Belgian study population, genotyping data of SNPs generated in a UK population were reanalyzed. RESULTS: In our Belgian study population, associations were found for two SNPs (rs11573871, rs1485286) and for one multimarker test involving rs1032129. When subsequently analyzing men and women separately, these associations turned out to be driven by women (56 cases, 78 controls). In addition, three other tagSNPs turned out to be associated in women only. These were rs2073617 (C950T), rs6415470, and rs11573869. Reanalysis of genotyping data from a UK study population indicated that the associations found for C950T and C1181G were also exclusively driven by women (146 cases, 216 controls). Meta-analysis provided evidence for risk increasing effects of the T allele of C950T and the G allele of C1181G in the female population (p = 0.002 and 0.003, respectively). The haplotypes formed by the SNPs associated in the Belgian population were also distributed differentially between female cases and controls. CONCLUSIONS: We showed for the first time that SNPs influencing the risk to develop PDB could be sex-specific. Further research is necessary to identify the causative variants in TNFRSF11B and to elucidate the molecular pathogenic mechanism.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1546" length="5"></location><text>C950T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2073617</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17289909</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>IGF-II gene region polymorphisms related to exertional muscle damage.		We examined the association of a novel single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IGF-I (IGF-I -C1245T located in the promoter) and eight SNPs in the IGF-II gene region with indicators of muscle damage [strength loss, muscle soreness, and increases in circulating levels of creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin] after eccentric exercise. We also examined two SNPs in the IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). The age, height, and body mass of the 151 subjects studied were 24.1 +/- 5.2 yr, 170.8 +/- 9.9 cm, and 73.3 +/- 17.0 kg, respectively. There were no significant associations of phenotypes with IGF-I. IGF-II SNP (G12655A, rs3213216) and IGFBP-3 SNP (A8618T, rs6670) were not significantly associated with any variable. The most significant finding in this study was that for men, IGF-II (C13790G, rs3213221), IGF-II (ApaI, G17200A, rs680), IGF-II antisense (IGF2AS) (G11711T, rs7924316), and IGFBP-3 (-C1592A, rs2132570) were significantly associated with muscle damage indicators. We found that men who were 1) homozygous for the rare IGF-II C13790G allele and rare allele for the ApaI (G17200A) SNP demonstrated the greatest strength loss immediately after exercise, greatest soreness, and highest postexercise serum CK activity; 2) homozygous wild type for IGF2AS (G11711T, rs7924316) had the greatest strength loss and most muscle soreness; and 3) homozygous wild type for the IGF2AS G11711T SNP showed the greatest strength loss, highest muscle soreness, and greater CK and myoglobin response to exercise.

Cancer is a common multifactor human disease resulting from complex interactions between many genetic and environmental factors. In this study, we used a multifaceted analytic approach to explore the relationship between eight single nucleotide polymorphisms in base excision repair (BER) pathway genes, smoking, and bladder cancer susceptibility in a hospital-based case-control study. Overall, we did not find an association between any single BER gene single nucleotide polymorphism and bladder cancer risk. However, in stratified analysis, the OGG1 S326C variant genotypes in ever smokers (odds ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.99) and ADP-ribosyltransferase (ADPRT) V762A variant genotypes in never smokers (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-0.91) conferred a significantly reduced risk. Using logistic regression, we observed that there was a two-way interaction between ADPRT V762A and smoking status. We next used classification and regression tree analysis to explore high-order gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. We found that smoking is the most important influential factor for bladder cancer risk. Consistent with the above findings, we found that the ADPRT V762A was only significantly involved in bladder cancer risk in never smokers and the OGG1 S326C was only significantly involved in ever smokers. We also observed gene-gene interactions among OGG1 S326C, XRCC1 R194W, and MUTYH H335Q in ever smokers. Using multifactor dimensionality reduction approach, the four-factor model, including smoking status, OGG1 S326C (rs1052133), APEX1 D148E (rs3136820), and ADPRT762 (rs1136410), had the best ability to predict bladder cancer risk with the highest cross-validation consistency (100%) and the lowest prediction error (37.02%; P &lt; 0.001).

PURPOSE: Polymorphisms in the VEGF gene have been identified that are believed to have functional activity. We hypothesized that such polymorphisms may affect survival outcomes among early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between VEGF polymorphisms and overall survival (OS) among patients with early-stage NSCLC treated with surgical resection at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1992 to 2001. We specifically investigated the VEGF polymorphisms +936C&gt;T (rs3025039), -460T&gt;C (rs833061), and +405G&gt;C (rs2010963). Analyses of genotype associations with survival outcomes were performed using Cox proportional hazards models, Kaplan-Meier methods, and the log-rank test. RESULTS: There were 462 patients and 237 deaths. Patients carrying the variant C allele of the VEGF +405G&gt;C polymorphism had significantly improved survival (crude hazard ratio [HR] = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.90; P = .006; adjusted HR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.91; P = .008). Five-year OS for patients carrying the variant C allele of the VEGF +405G&gt;C polymorphism was 61% (95% CI, 54% to 67%) versus 51% (95% CI, 43% to 59%) for those who had the wild-type variant. There was a trend toward improved survival among patients carrying the variant T allele of the VEGF +936C&gt;T polymorphism (crude HR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.03; P = .07; adjusted HR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.03; P = .07). Moreover, patients with higher number of variant alleles of the +405G&gt;C and +936C&gt;T polymorphisms had better survival. There was no association found with the -460T&gt;C polymorphism. CONCLUSION: Polymorphisms in VEGF may affect survival in early-stage lung cancer.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="641" length="7"></location><text>+405G&gt;C</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="596" length="7"></location><text>+936C&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="617" length="7"></location><text>-460T&gt;C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2010963</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs833061</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3025039</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17894153</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Ala55Val polymorphism on UCP2 gene predicts greater weight loss in morbidly obese patients undergoing gastric banding.		BACKGROUND: Variability in weight loss has been observed from morbidly obese patients receiving bariatric operations. Genetic effects may play a crucial role in this variability. METHODS: 304 morbidly obese patients (BMI &gt; or =39) were recruited, 77 receiving laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) and 227 laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass (LMGB), and 304 matched non-obese controls (BMI &lt; or =24). Initially, all subjects were genotyped for 4 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) on UCP2 gene in a case-control study. The SNPs significantly associated with morbid obesity (P &lt; 0.05) were considered as candidate markers affecting weight change. Subsequently, effects on predicting weight loss of those candidate markers were explored in LAGB and LMGB, respectively. The peri-operative parameters were also compared between LAGB and LMGB. RESULTS: The rs660339 (Ala55Val), on exon 4, was associated with morbid obesity (P = 0.049). Morbidly obese patients with either TT or CT genotypes on rs660339 experienced greater weight loss compared to patients with CC after LAGB at 12 months (BMI loss 12.2 units vs 8.1 units) and 24 months (BMI loss 13.1 units vs 9.3 units). However, this phenomenon was not observed in patients after LMGB. Although greater weight loss was observed in patients receiving LMGB, this procedure had a higher operative complication rate than LAGB (7.5% vs. 2.8%; P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Ala55Val may play a crucial role in obesity development and weight loss after LAGB. It may be considered as clinicians incorporate genetic susceptibility testing into weight loss prediction prior to bariatric operations.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="0" length="8"></location><text>Ala55Val</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs660339</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16645995</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Vascular endothelial growth factor gene haplotypes in Kawasaki disease.		OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether common genetic variants in the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene are associated with Kawasaki disease (KD) and the subsequent development of coronary artery lesions. METHODS: Common genetic variants in the VEGF gene were analyzed in an association study in a Dutch cohort of 170 KD patients and 300 healthy Dutch Caucasian controls. Genotyping was done with 5'-nuclease TaqMan assays and 3'-hybridization-triggered fluorescence minor groove binder Eclipse assays. RESULTS: An association with susceptibility to KD was observed with 2 of the 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms analyzed in VEGF: -2594 A&gt;C (rs699947) and the 236 bp 3' of STP C&gt;T (rs3025039). Also for an 18-bp deletion in the promoter of VEGF a significant difference in the genotype and allele frequencies was observed between the KD patients and the controls. The haplotype CGCC (based on rs699947, rs2010963, rs25648, and rs3025039) was significantly associated with the development of KD (hap score 3.8; P = 0.0002). VEGF plasma levels were significantly higher in patients with the early phase of KD than in the healthy controls, and there was a trend toward higher VEGF plasma levels in KD patients with the -2594 CC and 236 bp 3' of STP CC genotypes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that polymorphisms of the VEGF gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of KD.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="713" length="9"></location><text>-2594 A&gt;C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs699947</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17309124</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Interaction between birthweight and polymorphism in the calcium-sensing receptor gene in determination of adult bone mass: the Hertfordshire cohort study.		OBJECTIVE: We sought evidence of interaction between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) gene and early life in determination of bone mineral density (BMD) among individuals from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study. METHODS: Four hundred ninety-eight men and 468 women aged 59-71 years were recruited. A lifestyle questionnaire was administered and BMD at lumbar spine and femoral neck was measured. DNA was obtained from whole blood samples using standard extraction techniques. Five SNP of the CASR gene termed CASRV1 (rs1801725, G--&gt;T, S986A), CASRV2 (rs7614486, T--&gt;G, untranslated), CASRV3 (rs4300957, untranslated), CASRV4 (rs3804592 G--&gt;A, intron), and CASRV5 (rs1393189, T--&gt;C, intron) were analyzed. RESULTS: Among women the 11 genotype of the CASRV3 SNP was associated with higher lumbar spine BMD within the lowest birthweight tertile, while the opposite pattern was observed among individuals in the highest birthweight tertile (test for interaction on 1 df, p = 0.005, adjusted for age, body mass index, physical activity, dietary calcium intake, cigarette and alcohol consumption, social class, menopausal status, and hormone replacement therapy use). Similar relationships were seen at the total femur (p = 0.042, fully adjusted) with birthweight and at the total femur according to weight at 1 year tertile among women (p &lt; 0.001, fully adjusted). One haplotype was associated with lumbar spine BMD in women (p = 0.008, fully adjusted); these findings were replicated in a second cohort. CONCLUSION: We have found evidence of an interaction between a SNP of the CASR gene and birthweight in determination of bone mass in a UK female population.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="731" length="5"></location><text>S986A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1801725</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16261413</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Estrogen receptor beta (ESR2) polymorphisms in familial and sporadic breast cancer.		Estrogen is involved in both normal mammary development and in breast carcinogenesis. A family history of disease and exposure to estrogen are major risk factors for developing breast cancer. Estrogen exerts its biological effects through binding to the estrogen receptors, estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and the more recently discovered estrogen receptor beta (ESR2). Genetic variation in genes involved in estrogen biosynthesis, metabolism and signal transduction have been suggested to play a role in breast cancer risk. We therefore tested the hypothesis that common genetic variants of the ESR2 gene may be associated with increased risk for breast cancer and this risk may vary between breast cancer groups. We investigated three common ESR2 polymorphisms, rs1256049 (G1082A), rs4986938 (G1730A) and rs928554 (Cx+56 A--&gt;G) for association to breast cancer risk. A total of 723 breast cancer cases and 480 controls were included in the study. Of the breast cancer cases, 323 were sporadic and 400 were familial, the familial cases were further divided into familial high-risk and familial low-risk breast cancer cases. We found no overall statistically significant association for any of the single polymorphisms studied. Haplotype analysis suggested one haplotype associated with increased risk in sporadic breast cancer patients (OR = 3.0, p = 0.03). Further analysis is needed to elucidate the role of estrogen receptor beta in breast cancer susceptibility.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="859" length="6"></location><text>G1082A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="879" length="6"></location><text>G1730A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1256049</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4986938</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18249219</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Interaction of single nucleotide polymorphisms in ADRB2, ADRB3, TNF, IL6, IGF1R, LIPC, LEPR, and GHRL with physical activity on the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and changes in characteristics of the metabolic syndrome: The Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study.		Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the ADRB2, ADRB3, TNF, IL6, IGF1R, LIPC, LEPR, and GHRL genes were associated with the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS). In this study, we determined whether polymorphisms in these genes modified the effect of changes in physical activity (PA) on the risk of T2D in the DPS. Moreover, we assessed whether the polymorphisms modified the effect of changes in PA on changes in measures of body fat, serum lipids, and blood pressure during the first year of the follow-up of the DPS. Overweight subjects with IGT (n = 487) were followed for an average of 4.1 years, and PA was assessed annually with a questionnaire. The interactions of the polymorphisms with changes in total and moderate-to-vigorous PA on the conversion to T2D during the 4.1-year follow-up were assessed using Cox regression with adjustments for the other components of the intervention (dietary changes, weight reduction). Univariate analysis of variance was used to assess interactions on changes in continuous variables during the first year of the follow-up. No interaction between the polymorphisms and PA on the conversion to T2D was found. The Leu72Met (rs696217) polymorphism in GHRL modified the effect of moderate-to-vigorous PA on changes in weight and waist circumference, the -501A/C (rs26802) polymorphism in GHRL modified the effect of total and moderate-to-vigorous PA on change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the Lys109Arg (rs1137100) polymorphism in LEPR modified the effect of total PA on change in blood pressure. In conclusion, genetic variation may modify the magnitude of the beneficial effects of PA on characteristics of the metabolic syndrome in persons with IGT.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1657" length="7"></location><text>-501A/C</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1812" length="9"></location><text>Lys109Arg</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1519" length="8"></location><text>Leu72Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs26802</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs696217</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1137100</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15956988</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>COMT polymorphisms and anxiety-related personality traits.		High neuroticism and low extraversion are characteristic of anxiety-prone individuals. A functional variant in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, the Val158Met ('val/met') polymorphism, has been associated in some prior studies with several phenotypes, including neuroticism. We tested the hypothesis that the val158met polymorphism would be associated with both high neuroticism and low extraversion, making it a plausible candidate locus for anxiety susceptibility. To determine whether val158met is responsible for these effects, we also evaluated the association with haplotypes that included two other SNPs within the COMT gene. We collected a sample of 497 undergraduate college students who were phenotyped on a personality inventory (the NEO-Personality Inventory-Raised (NEO-PI-R)). Subjects were genotyped for three COMT polymorphisms: the well-studied nonsynonymous SNP rs4680 that generates a valine-to-methionine substitution (val158met), rs737865 (near exon #1), and rs165599 (also functional, near the 3'-UTR). Together, these three SNPs define a haplotype that is associated with reduced COMT expression in human brain. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine the effects of individual SNPs on extraversion and neuroticism scores. Score tests for association between these traits (quantitatively and dichotomously considered) and haplotypes were also conducted. We evaluated potential for population stratification artifact by genotyping a set of 36 unlinked highly polymorphic markers previously demonstrated to distinguish sufficiently ancestry of major American populations. Two of the SNPs (rs4680 ('val/met') and rs737865) were significantly associated with (low) extraversion and, less consistently, with (high) neuroticism, with effects confined to women. A significant association between COMT haplotype and (low) extraversion and (high) neuroticism was also observed. Formal testing showed that population structure did not explain the findings. These data suggest that involvement of the COMT locus in susceptibility to anxiety-related traits (ie low extraversion and high neuroticism) is unlikely to be wholly accounted for by the well-studied rs4680 ('val/met') polymorphism. Other functional variants may exist that contribute to this relationship. Possible sex-specific effects remain to be further studied and explained.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="221" length="9"></location><text>Val158Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4680</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>11933203</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>An osteopontin (SPP1) polymorphism is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.

We examined a polymorphism of osteopontin for an association with lupus in humans in an effort to determine whether there is any evidence that a genetic predisposition to altered osteopontin expression might explain the overexpression seen in human SLE patients. A silent polymorphism (707C&gt;T, rs1126616) of osteopontin was significantly associated with SLE. Additional associations with renal disease and opportunisitic infections were suggested.

OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies showing an association between the melanocortin-4-receptor (MC4R) 103I variant (rs2229616) and decreased BMI are complemented by functional studies; these suggest a mechanism for appetite regulation and a linkage signal for physical activity and dietary intake for the region encompassing the MC4R. This study aims to provide epidemiological evidence for showing the association of this polymorphism with features of the metabolic syndrome and with parameters related to energy expenditure and dietary habits as potential mediators. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: We analyzed this polymorphism in 7,888 adults of a population-based cross-sectional study applying regression-based statistical models. RESULTS: Carriers of the MC4R 103I (3.7%) exhibited a significantly decreased waist circumference (-1.46 cm, P = 0.020), decreased glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) (-0.09%, P = 0.040), and increased HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) (+1.76 mg/dl, P = 0.056), but no change in blood pressure. The odds of having three or more components of the metabolic syndrome were substantially reduced among carriers of MC4R 103I (odds ratio (OR) = 0.46, P = 0.003). Controlling for BMI reduced the HbA(1c) and HDL-C association. Mediator analyses revealed a borderline association of MC4R 103I with carbohydrate intake (OR = 1.26, P = 0.059) possibly mediating association with leanness. DISCUSSION: Our representative study of well-phenotyped Europeans is the first to describe the association of the MC4R V103I with the metabolic syndrome and with a nutrient-related phenotype. Our data support the idea that this polymorphism plays a role in appetite regulation that not only affects BMI, but also other features of the metabolic syndrome. It further establishes that the association of the MC4R V103I with obesity and related phenotypes is genuine.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="24" length="5"></location><text>V103I</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2229616</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18278815</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic variants in IRF6 and the risk of facial clefts: single-marker and haplotype-based analyses in a population-based case-control study of facial clefts in Norway.		Mutations in the gene encoding interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) underlie a common form of syndromic clefting known as Van der Woude syndrome. Lip pits and missing teeth are the only additional features distinguishing the syndrome from isolated clefts. Van der Woude syndrome, therefore, provides an excellent model for studying the isolated forms of clefting. From a population-based case-control study of facial clefts in Norway (1996-2001), we selected 377 cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P), 196 cleft palate only (CPO), and 763 control infant-parent triads for analysis. We genotyped six single nucleotide polymorphisms within the IRF6 locus and estimated the relative risks (RR) conferred on the child by alleles and haplotypes of the child and of the mother. On the whole, there were strong statistical associations with CL/P but not CPO in our data. In single-marker analyses, mothers with a double-dose of the 'a'-allele at rs4844880 had an increased risk of having a child with CL/P (RR=1.85, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-3.25; P=0.036). An RR of 0.38 (95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.92; P=0.031) was obtained when the child carried a single-dose of the 'a'-allele at rs2235371 (the p.V274I polymorphism). The P-value for the overall test was &lt;0.001. In haplotype analyses, several of the fetal and maternal haplotype relative risks were statistically significant individually but were not strong enough to show up on the overall test (P=0.113). Taken together, these findings further support a role for IRF6 variants in clefting of the lip and provide specific risk estimates in a Norwegian population.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1379" length="7"></location><text>p.V274I</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2235371</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16338218</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of the -112A&gt;C polymorphism of the uncoupling protein 1 gene with insulin resistance in Japanese individuals with type 2 diabetes.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of this polymorphism, as well as the well-known -3826A&gt;G polymorphism (rs1800592), on clinical characteristics of type 2 diabetes. We determined the genotypes of the two polymorphisms in 93 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. Intramyocellular lipid content and hepatic lipid content (HLC) were measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. No significant differences in age, sex, BMI, or HbA1c level were detected between type 2 diabetic patients with the -112C allele and those without it. However, homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (p=0.0089) and HLC (p=0.012) was significantly greater in patients with the -112C allele. We did not detect an association of the -3826A&gt;G polymorphism (rs1800592) of UCP1 gene with any measured parameters.

Asthma, bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) and atopic asthma phenotypes were analyzed for the family-based association. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with asthma (0.0017&lt;or=P&lt;or=0.0291), five with BHR (0.0026&lt;or=P&lt;or=0.0315) and three with atopic asthma (0.0016&lt;or=P&lt;or=0.041) in the UK population.

Each RA-associated SNP was consistently mapped to 3 distinct regions of strong linkage disequilibrium (i.e., linkage disequilibrium or haplotype blocks) in the PRKCH gene locus, suggesting that multiple causal variants influence disease susceptibility. Significant SNPs included a novel common missense polymorphism of the PRKCH gene, V374I (rs2230500), which lies within the ATP-binding site that is highly conserved among PKC superfamily members. In circulating lymphocytes, PRKCH messenger RNA was expressed at higher levels in resting T cells (CD4(+) or CD8(+)) than in B cells (CD19(+)) or monocytes (CD14(+)) and was significantly down-regulated through immune responses. CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence of the involvement of PRKCH as a susceptibility gene for RA in the Japanese population. Dysregulation of PKCeta signal transduction pathway(s) may confer increased risk of RA through aberrant T cell-mediated autoimmune responses.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1179" length="5"></location><text>V374I</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2230500</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17480010</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Variants of the ST6GALNAC2 promoter influence transcriptional activity and contribute to genetic susceptibility to IgA nephropathy.		IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a polygenic disorder. Increasing evidence has implicated that aberrant glycosylation of IgA1 molecules, including alpha2,6 sialic acid defects, are involved in the pathogenesis of IgAN. In the present study, we designed an association study to investigate polymorphisms of two important genes, ST6GALNAC2 and NEU1, which are involved in the sialylation of the IgA1 molecule, in the susceptibility to IgAN. A total of 670 patients with histologically proven IgAN and 494 healthy controls were enrolled. Screening of SNPs in the coding and promoter regions of the ST6GALNAC2 and NEU1 genes was performed by sequencing. ST6-SNP1 (c.-988A&gt;G), ST6-SNP2 [rs3840858:D&gt;I(CGGC), c.-450_-449insCGGC], ST6-SNP3 (rs1867561:C&gt;G, c.-135C&gt;G), and ST6-SNP7 (rs2304921:G&gt;A, c.186+12G&gt;A) in the ST6GALNAC2 gene were selected as tagging SNPs. Functional evaluations of targets were assayed by luciferase activity. The alpha2,6 sialic acid contents of serum IgA1 in 497 patients were analyzed. Our results demonstrated that the frequency of haplotype ADG in the promoter region of ST6GALNAC2 was significantly higher in IgAN patients than that in controls (p=0.0069; odds ratio [OR]=1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.72). Furthermore, the ADG haplotype was associated with the deficient degrees of alpha2,6 sialic acid of IgA1 molecules in IgAN patients (r=0.408, p=0.0035). The ADG haplotype conferred significantly reduced promoter activity compared with the most common haplotype GDG in vitro (196.43+/-21.55 vs. 258.41+/-46.25; p=0.002). In the present study, we identified for the first time the ADG haplotype in the ST6GALNAC2 gene as a functional regulatory variant that may contribute to the genetic susceptibility in a subset of patients in whom the desialylation of IgA1 molecules was the main causative pathogenesis of IgAN.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="875" length="9"></location><text>c.-135C&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="916" length="11"></location><text>c.186+12G&gt;A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1867561</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2304921</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17517687</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of variants in the BAT1-NFKBIL1-LTA genomic region with protection against myocardial infarction in Europeans.		Single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the BAT1-NFKBIL1-LTA genomic region (6p21.3) and the LGALS2 gene (22q13.1), encoding a regulator for lymphotoxin-alpha, the product of the LTA gene, have been reported to be linked with the risk of myocardial infarction in Japanese. We employed nine polymorphisms from the BAT1-NFKBIL1-LTA region and one polymorphism from the LGALS2 gene, and investigated whether such associations were also present in Europeans. The study included 3657 patients with myocardial infarction and 1211 control individuals with angiographically normal coronary arteries. Minor homozygous genotypes of polymorphisms in BAT1 (rs2239527, -23C/G), NFKBIL1 (rs2071592, -63T/A) and LTA (rs1800683, -162G/A; rs909253, 252G/A; rs1041981, Thr26Asn) were associated with moderately protective effects against myocardial infarction (P &lt;/= 0.045). The most abundant 9-marker haplotype of the BAT1-NFKBIL1-LTA region, named haplotype 1 (28% frequency in the study population), included the alleles of the five protective genotypes and was related with a significantly lower risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.98; P = 0.015). Moreover, homozygosity for haplotype 1 was associated with an OR 0.72 (95% CI 0.57-0.90; P = 0.0047). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an independent protective effect against myocardial infarction in the homozygous carriers of haplotype 1 (adjusted OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.99; P = 0.043). A putative risk genotype of the polymorphism in the LGALS2 gene (rs7291467; 3279T/C) was not associated with myocardial infarction (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.83-1.16; P = 0.84). Our finding that protective effects are linked with minor homozygous genotypes and haplotype 1 of the BAT1-NFKBIL1-LTA region in Europeans is opposite to the observation of associated risks in Japanese.</text><annotation id="T6"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="874" length="8"></location><text>Thr26Asn</text></annotation><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1654" length="7"></location><text>3279T/C</text></annotation><annotation id="T5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="808" length="6"></location><text>-63T/A</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="836" length="7"></location><text>-162G/A</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="855" length="6"></location><text>252G/A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="779" length="6"></location><text>-23C/G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1800683</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2239527</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#6"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1041981</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T6" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2071592</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T5" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs7291467</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs909253</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17709632</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Common genetic variation in KCNH2 is associated with QT interval duration: the Framingham Heart Study.		BACKGROUND: QT prolongation is associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death in the general population and in people exposed to QT-prolonging drugs. Mutations in the KCNH2 gene encoding the HERG potassium channel cause 30% of long-QT syndrome, and binding to this channel leads to drug-induced QT prolongation. We tested common KCNH2 variants for association with continuous QT interval duration. METHODS AND RESULTS: We selected 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms and rs1805123, a previously associated missense single nucleotide polymorphism, for genotyping in 1730 unrelated men and women from the Framingham Heart Study. rs3807375 genotypes were associated with continuous QT interval duration in men and women (2-df P=0.002), with a dominant model suggested (P=0.0004). An independent sample of 871 Framingham Heart Study men and women replicated the association (1-sided dominant P=0.02). On combined analysis of 2123 subjects, individuals with AA or AG genotypes had a 0.14-SD (SE, 0.04) or 3.9-ms higher age-, sex- and RR-adjusted QT interval compared with GG individuals (P=0.00006). The previously reported association of rs1805123 (K897T) replicated under a dominant (AA/AC, 0.12 [corrected] SD [SE, 0.07] or 3.1 ms higher versus CC; 1-sided P=0.04) or additive model (0.06 SD [SE, 0.03] or 1.6 ms higher per A allele; 1-sided P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Two common genetic variants at the KCNH2 locus are associated with continuous QT interval duration in an unselected community-based sample. Studies to determine the influence of these variants on risk of sudden cardiac death and drug-induced arrhythmias should be considered.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1256" length="5"></location><text>K897T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1805123</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18296645</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Polymorphisms of genes in the lipid metabolism pathway and risk of biliary tract cancers and stones: a population-based case-control study in Shanghai, China.		Biliary tract cancers, encompassing the gallbladder, extrahepatic bile duct, and ampulla of Vater, are uncommon yet highly fatal malignancies. Gallstones, the primary risk factor for biliary cancers, are linked with hyperlipidemia. We examined the associations of 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms of five genes in the lipid metabolism pathway with the risks of biliary cancers and stones in a population-based case-control study in Shanghai, China. We included 235 gallbladder, 125 extrahepatic bile duct, and 46 ampulla of Vater cancer cases, 880 biliary stone cases, and 779 population controls. Subjects completed an in-person interview and gave blood. Genotyping was conducted by TaqMan assay using DNA from buffy coats. The effects of APOE IVS1+69 (rs440446) and APOB IVS6+360C&gt;T (rs520354) markers were limited to men. Men carrying the G allele of APOE IVS1+69 had a 1.7-fold risk of stones [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.2-2.4], a 1.8-fold risk of gallbladder cancer (95% CI, 1.0-3.3), a 3.7-fold risk of bile duct cancer (95% CI, 2.0-7.0), and a 4-fold risk of ampullary cancer (95% CI, 1.4-12.4). Male carriers of the T allele of APOB IVS6+360C&gt;T had a 2-fold risk of bile duct cancer (95% CI, 1.2-3.4). The APOB T-T haplotype (APOB IVS6+360C&gt;T, EX4+56C&gt;T) was associated with a 1.6-fold risk of bile duct cancer (95% CI, 1.1-2.3). Male and female carriers of the T allele of LDLR IVS9-30C&gt;T (rs1003723) had a 1.5-fold risk of bile duct cancer. Our findings suggest that gene variants in the lipid metabolism pathway contribute to the risk of biliary tract stones and cancers, particularly of the bile duct.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="935" length="11"></location><text>IVS6+360C&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1558" length="10"></location><text>IVS9-30C&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs520354</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1003723</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16453382</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>No evidence for a major effect of two common polymorphisms of the catalase gene in type 1 diabetes susceptibility.		BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a multifactorial disease, the genetic analysis of which has yielded few true positive linkage and association results. Replication of association in independent, large-sample studies is essential to further identify the genes involved in T1D. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the catalase gene have been reported to be associated with T1D. METHODS: Major effects of two SNPs, C1167T (rs769217) and C(-262)T (rs1001179), of the catalase gene on T1D susceptibility have been reported previously in Russians from Moscow. We genotyped C1167T and C(-262)T in large family (1642 families) and British case-control (3530 cases and 3930 controls) collections and tested for association with T1D. RESULTS: We found no evidence of an association between T1D and C1167T or C(-262)T in either the family or case-control collections, or for the D11S2008 microsatellite polymorphism in families. However, we did find limited statistical evidence of an association at C1167T in USA families (P = 0.033; RR for 1167C = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.02-1.49) and C(-262)T in UK families (P = 0.046; RR for (-262)C = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.75-0.99). CONCLUSION: We found no evidence for a major effect of C1167T or C(-262)T on T1D susceptibility in two large sample collections. Limited statistical evidence of an association at C1167T in USA families and C(-262)T in UK families was found, but these results are likely to be false positives. The previously reported association of these SNPs may also have been a false positive, or a population specific association in Russians from Moscow.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="542" length="6"></location><text>C1167T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="564" length="8"></location><text>C(-262)T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs769217</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1001179</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17216208</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>The functional Pro129Thr variant of the FAAH gene is not associated with various fat accumulation phenotypes in a population-based cohort of 5,801 whites.

INTRODUCTION: Bone mineral density (BMD) is the major factor for determining bone strength, which is closely correlated to osteoporotic fracture risk and is largely determined by multiple genetic factors. The RANK (TNFRSF11A), receptor for RANKL, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily and plays a central role in osteoclast development. METHODS: In order to investigate the effects of RANK polymorphism on BMD and osteoporosis, we directly sequenced the RANK gene in 24 Korean individuals and identified 25 sequence variants. Eleven of these polymorphisms were selected and genotyped in a larger-scale study of postmenopausal women (n = 560). Areal BMD (g/cm(2)) of the anterior-posterior lumbar spine and the nondominant proximal femur were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: We found that two intronic polymorphisms in the RANK gene [RANK + 34863G &gt; A (rs12458117) and RANK + 35928insdelC (new polymorphism found in this study) in intron 6] were significantly associated with the BMD of the lumbar spine, i.e., rare alleles were significantly associated with low BMD of the lumbar spine among Korean postmenopausal women (p = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). These polymorphisms were also associated with low BMD of proximal femur sites, including Ward's triangle, trochanter, and total femur. Our results suggest that +34863G &gt; A and +35928insdelC polymorphisms in RANK are possible genetic factors for low BMD in postmenopausal women.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1013" length="10"></location><text>34863G &gt; A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs12458117</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17611642</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Kinesin gene variability may affect tau phosphorylation in early Alzheimer's disease.		Kinesin is a microtubule-associated motor protein that transports Alzheimer-associated amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neurons. In animal models, impaired kinesin-mediated APP transport seems to enhance formation of the neurotoxic 42 amino acid fragment of beta-amyloid (A beta 42). In man, one study suggests that a polymorphism (rs8702, 56,836G&gt;C) in the kinesin light chain 1 gene (KNS2) may affect the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To further assess KNS2 as a susceptibility gene for AD we analyzed 802 patients with sporadic AD and 286 controls, 134 longitudinally followed patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 39 cognitively stable controls for the rs8702 polymorphism. The rs8702 polymorphism did not influence risk of AD (p=0.46). However, rs8702 interacted with APOE epsilon 4 carrier status in AD (p=0.006) and influenced cerebrospinal fluid levels of hyperphosphorylated tau in MCI patients who converted to AD during follow-up (p=0.018). These findings support earlier indications that genetic variability in the KNS2 gene may play a role during early stages of AD pathogenesis.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="429" length="9"></location><text>56,836G&gt;C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs8702</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18092344</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>No association of the CARD8 (TUCAN) c.30T&gt;A (p.C10X) variant with Crohn's disease: a study in 3 independent European cohorts.		BACKGROUND: A recent study reported that the c.30T&gt;A (p.Cys10Ter; rs2043211) variant, in the CARD8 (TUCAN) gene, is associated with Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency of p.C10X in 3 independent European (IBD) cohorts from Germany, Hungary, and the Netherlands. METHODS: We included a European IBD cohort of 921 patients and compared the p.C10X genotype frequency to 832 healthy controls. The 3 study populations analyzed were: (1) Germany [CD, n = 317; ulcerative colitis (UC), n = 180], (2) Hungary (CD, n = 149; UC, n = 119), and (3) the Netherlands (CD, n = 156). Subtyping analysis was performed in respect to NOD2 variants (p.Arg702Trp, p.Gly908Arg, c.3020insC) and to clinical characteristics. Ethnically matched controls were included (German, n = 413; Hungarian, n = 202; Dutch, n = 217). RESULTS: We observed no significant difference in p.C10X genotype frequency in either patients with CD or patients with UC compared with controls in all 3 cohorts. Conversely to the initial association study, we found a trend toward lower frequencies of the suggestive risk wild type in CD from the Netherlands compared with controls (P = 0.14). We found neither evidence for genetic interactions between p.C10X and NOD2 nor the C10X variant to be associated with a CD or UC phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Analyzing 3 independent European IBD cohorts, we found no evidence that the C10X variant in CARD8 confers susceptibility for CD.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="36" length="7"></location><text>c.30T&gt;A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="45" length="6"></location><text>p.C10X</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2043211</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2043211</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16783567</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Cyclin D1 splice variant and risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Phenotypic characteristics expressed in syndromes give clues to the factors involved in the cause of isolated forms of the same defects. We investigated two genes responsible for craniofacial syndromes, FGFR1 and IRF6, in a collection of families with isolated tooth agenesis. Cheek swab samples were obtained for DNA analysis from 116 case/parent trios. Probands had at least one developmentally missing tooth, excluding third molars. In addition, we studied 89 cases and 50 controls from Ohio to replicate any positive findings. Genotyping was performed by kinetic polymerase chain-reaction or TaqMan assays. Linkage disequilibrium analysis and transmission distortion of the marker alleles were performed. The same variants in the IRF6 gene that are associated with isolated orofacial clefts are also associated with human tooth agenesis (rs861019, P = 0.058; rs17015215-V274I, P = 0.0006; rs7802, P = 0.004). Mutations in IRF6 cause Van der Woude and popliteal pterygium syndromes. The craniofacial phenotypic characteristics of these syndromes include oral clefts and preferential tooth agenesis of incisors and premolars, besides pits on the lower lips. Also it appears that preferential premolar agenesis is associated with FGFR1 (P = 0.014) and IRF6 (P = 0.002) markers. There were statistically significant data suggesting that IRF6 interacts not only with MSX1 (P = 0.001), but also with TGFA (P = 0.03).</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="997" length="5"></location><text>V274I</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2235371</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17582620</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>The glycine transporter 1 gene (GLYT1) is associated with methamphetamine-use disorder.		Glycine transporter (GlyT)-1 plays a pivotal role in maintaining the glycine level at the glutamatergic synapse. Glycine is an allosteric agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Because activation of NMDA receptors is an essential step for induction of methamphetamine dependence and psychosis, differences in the functioning of GlyT-1 due to genetic variants of the GlyT-1 gene (GLYT1) may influence susceptibility. A case-control genetic association study of the GLYT1 gene examined 204 patients with methamphetamine-use disorder and 210 healthy controls. We examined three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), SNP1, IVS3 + 411C &gt; T, rs2486001; SNP2, 1056G &gt; A, rs2248829; and SNP3, IVS11 + 22G &gt; A, rs2248632, of the GLYT1 gene and found that SNP1 showed a significant association in both genotype (P = 0.0086) and allele (P = 0.0019) with methamphetamine-use disorder. The T-G haplotype at SNP1 and SNP2 was a significant risk factor for the disorder (P = 0.000039, odds ratio: 2.04). The present findings indicate that genetic variation of the GLYT1 gene may contribute to individual vulnerability to methamphetamine dependence and psychosis.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="755" length="9"></location><text>1056G &gt; A</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="721" length="15"></location><text>IVS3 + 411C &gt; T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="787" length="15"></location><text>IVS11 + 22G &gt; A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2248829</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2248632</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2486001</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17913323</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>ABCB1 (MDR1) gene polymorphisms are associated with the clinical response to paroxetine in patients with major depressive disorder.		Variability in antidepressant response is due to genetic and environmental factors. Among genetic factors, the ones controlling for availability of the drug at the target site are interesting candidates. Multidrug resistance 1 (ABCB1, MDR1) gene encodes a blood-brain barrier transporter P-glycoprotein that plays an important role in controlling the passage of substances between the blood and brain. In the present study, we therefore examined the possible association of 3 functional ABCB1 polymorphisms (C3435T: rs1045642, G2677T/A: rs2032582 and C1236T: rs1128503) with response to paroxetine in a Japanese major depression sample followed for 6 weeks. Analysis of covariance at week 6 with baseline scores included in the model as covariate showed significant association of the non-synonymous SNP G2677T/A with treatment response to paroxetine (p=0.011). Furthermore, the wild variants haplotype (3435C-2677G-1236T) resulted associated with poor response (p=0.006). To our best knowledge, this study is the first suggestion of a possible association of ABCB1 variants with SSRIs response.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="684" length="6"></location><text>C1236T</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="660" length="6"></location><text>G2677T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="641" length="6"></location><text>C3435T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1128503</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1045642</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2032582</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17761781</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Lack of association between common polymorphisms in UGT1A9 and gene expression and activity.		Interindividual variability in the glucuronidation of xenobiotics metabolized by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9) suggests the presence of functional UGT1A9 variants. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the putative functionality of the UGT1A9 variants-118T(9&gt;10) (rs3832043), I399C&gt;T (rs2741049), -275T&gt;A (rs6714486), and-2152C&gt;T (rs17868320) could be confirmed in an independent study. UGT1A9 genotypes and UGT1A9 activity (i.e., flavopiridol and mycophenolic acid glucuronidation) were determined in 46 Caucasian human livers. mRNA levels were quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 35 of these livers. In addition, samples from 60 unrelated Caucasians belonging to the HapMap Project were also genotyped to confirm the allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern observed in our Caucasian livers. The allele frequencies of the-118T(9&gt;10), I399C&gt;T, -275T&gt;A, and-2152C&gt;T variants were 0.39, 0.39, 0.02, and 0.02 in the livers, respectively. The I399C&gt;T variant was in complete LD (r(2) = 1) with-118T(9&gt;10) (linked alleles: C and T(9), respectively). Complete LD between these two variants was also found in the HapMap samples (frequencies of-118T(9&gt;10) and I399C&gt;T = 0.38). I399C&gt;T and-118T(9&gt;10) correlated with neither UGT1A9 activities nor mRNA levels. Because of the low frequencies of the-275T&gt;A and-2152C&gt;T variants, an effect on phenotype could not be evaluated. Our data demonstrate that the common I399C&gt;T and-118T(9&gt;10) polymorphisms do not explain interindividual variation in hepatic UGT1A9 activity and mRNA expression and are in complete LD in the donor liver samples we studied.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="434" length="8"></location><text>-2152C&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="410" length="7"></location><text>-275T&gt;A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs17868320</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6714486</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17237116</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Further evidence of the role of frizzled-related protein gene polymorphisms in osteoarthritis.		OBJECTIVE: To replicate the association of frizzled-related protein (FRZB) non-synonymous polymorphisms with osteoarthritis (OA) susceptibility. METHODS: Three groups of Spanish patients with OA were included: with total joint replacement due to primary OA in the hip (n = 310), or the knee (n = 277), or with hand OA (n = 242). Controls were more than 55 years old and did not show OA (n = 294). SNPs rs288326 (R200W) and rs7775 (R324G) were genotyped. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in allele frequencies between controls and each of the three groups of OA patients. However, allele G of the R324G SNP showed a trend to be more frequent in patients with a clinical OA syndrome at multiple joints (p = 0.07), specifically in women of the total hip replacement group (8.3% in patients without other affected joints, 13.1% with one, 15.9% with two and 24.1% with more than two additional joints, p for trend = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: No direct replication of previous OA association findings was obtained but the results suggest that the R324G SNP of the FRZB gene may have an effect in OA development in multiple joints, with a specific severe involvement of the hip in women. This phenotype could reconcile previous studies that showed association either with generalised OA or with hip OA in women.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="508" length="5"></location><text>R200W</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1146" length="5"></location><text>R324G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs288326</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs7775</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17994425</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Interleukin (IL)-12, IL-2, interferon-gamma gene polymorphisms in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis patients.		Mutated measles virus variants have been claimed as the causing agent for subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) developing several years after the recovery from measles infection. However, immune dysfunction may be considered related to a genetic susceptibility to this rare disease. Interleukin (IL)-2 -330 (rs2069 762) and +160 (rs2069 763), IL-12 p40 3' UTR (rs3213113), and interferon (IFN)-gamma +874 (rs2430561) polymorphisms are screened by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and PCR-sequence-specific priming (SSP) methods in 87 SSPE patients and 106 healthy controls (HCs) as candidate genes of susceptibility. The distribution of the IL12B genotypes (rs3213113) showed a trend for a significant difference (P = .053). The frequency of IL12B C allele (P = .04, OR: 1.6) and CC genotype (P = .03, OR: 3.2) were both higher in SSPE patients than in HC. The IL2 -330 genotypes revealed lower frequencies of GG genotype (P = .03, OR: 0.4) as well as G allele (P = .02, OR: 0.6) in SSPE. IL2 -330+160 TG haplotype was more frequent in patients (P = .005, OR: 1.8), whereas GG haplotype was less frequent, compared to controls (P = .02, OR: 0.6). IFNG +874 polymorphism revealed no difference. These findings implicate possible effects of genetic polymorphisms in the susceptibility to SSPE, which need to be confirmed in other populations.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1157" length="11"></location><text>-330+160 TG</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2069762</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15823203</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of sequence variability in the CART gene in relation to obesity in a Caucasian population.		BACKGROUND: Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript (CART) is an anorectic neuropeptide located principally in hypothalamus. CART has been shown to be involved in control of feeding behavior, but a direct relationship with obesity has not been established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of polymorphisms within the CART gene with regards to a possible association with obesity in a Caucasian population. RESULTS: Screening of the entire gene as well as a 3.7 kb region of 5' upstream sequence revealed 31 SNPs and 3 rare variants; 14 of which were subsequently genotyped in 292 French morbidly obese subjects and 368 controls. Haplotype analysis suggested an association with obesity which was found to be mainly due to SNP-3608T&gt;C (rs7379701) (p = 0.009). Genotyping additional cases and controls also of European Caucasian origin supported further this possible association between the CART SNP -3608T&gt;C T allele and obesity (global p-value = 0.0005). Functional studies also suggested that the SNP -3608T&gt;C could modulate nuclear protein binding. CONCLUSION: CART SNP -3608T&gt;C may possibly contribute to the genetic risk for obesity in the Caucasian population. However confirmation of the importance of the role of the CART gene in energy homeostasis and obesity will require investigation and replication in further populations.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="848" length="8"></location><text>-3608T&gt;C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs7379701</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16835863</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Paternal bias in parental origin of HRAS mutations in Costello syndrome.		Costello syndrome (CS) is a rare congenital condition caused by heterozygous de novo missense mutations affecting the codon for glycine 12 or 13 of the HRAS gene.

We analyzed the region flanking the mutated sites in 42 probands and 59 parents, and used four polymorphic markers to trace the parental origin of the germline mutations: one highly polymorphic hexanucleotide (GGGCCT) repeat region, defining three alleles with different numbers of repeat units (two, three, or four), and three SNPs. One of the SNPs, rs12628 (c.81T &gt; C), was found in strong linkage disequilibrium with the hexanucleotide repeat region. Out of a total of 24 probands with polymorphic markers, 16 informative families were tested and the paternal origin of the germline mutation was found in 14 CS probands; a distribution that is neither consistent with an equal likelihood of mutations arising in either parent (P = 0.0018), nor with exclusive paternal origin.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="834" length="9"></location><text>c.81T &gt; C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs12628</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16725228</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Gender-specific association of ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) polymorphisms with the risk of late-onset Alzheimer's disease.		Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder caused by a complex interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Increasing evidence highlights a potential role for cholesterol in the pathophysiology of AD. The ABCA1 gene, located in close vicinity to the 9q linkage peaks identified by genome-wide AD linkage studies, plays an important role in cellular cholesterol efflux, and is likely a good candidate gene. However, results from published genetic association studies between ABCA1 and AD are ambiguous. In the present study, we examined the role of two ABCA1 polymorphisms, R219K (rs2230806) and G-17C (rs2740483) in modifying the risk of late-onset AD (LOAD) in a large American white cohort of 992 AD cases and 699 controls. We observed significant gender x R219K interaction (p=0.00008). Female carriers of the 219K allele showed a 1.75-fold increased risk of developing AD compared to non-219K carrier females (95% CI 1.34-2.29; p=0.00004). The overall two-site haplotype distribution was also significant between female AD cases and controls (p=0.017). The risk associated with the R219K polymorphism was independent of the recently reported significant association in the ubiquilin (UBQLN1) gene in this region on chromosome 9q.

BACKGROUND: Generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAP) exhibits severe inflammation and alveolar bone loss. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) regulates both bone metabolism and inflammation-related genes, and its polymorphisms and haplotypes may affect the functional activity of the VDR protein in GAP. OBJECTIVE: We analysed the genetic effect of VDR start codon, intron, and exon polymorphisms, and their haplotypes on the development of GAP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The VDR start codon 27823C &gt; T (rs2228570, FokI), intron 8 60890G &gt; A (rs154410, BsmI), and exon 9 61968T &gt; C (rs731236, TaqI) polymorphisms were determined by using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis among 93 GAP patients and 143 healthy controls. RESULTS: The VDR start codon 27823*C/*C genotype was associated with an increased risk for GAP [odds ratio (OR) = 1.83, p = 0.028], but the intron 8 60880G &gt; A and exon 9 61968T &gt; C polymorphisms were not associated with GAP. The VDR haplotype homozygote ht1(C-G-T) carrying 27823*C allele was associated with a 1.8-fold increased risk of GAP (OR = 1.84, p = 0.030).

The gene encoding cathechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) contains a common functional missense polymorphism (Val158Met) that regulates dopamine in an allele-dependent manner. A pivotal role of dopamine neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex has been implicated in drug-seeking behavior and related personality traits, such as sensation seeking, with some evidence for a gender-specific association. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the COMT Val158Met polymorphism modulates the personality dimension, sensation seeking, in a gender-dependent manner. Study sample included 214 male (age 38.1+/-12.6 years) and 218 female (age 36.1+/-13.6 years) healthy volunteers, who were assessed with Zuckerman's sensation-seeking scale and genotyped for the Val158Met polymorphism (dbSNP:rs4680). Univariate analysis of variance showed that the sensation seeking score was significantly affected by a COMT genotype x gender interaction (F=5.330, df=2, p=0.005). The Val158Met polymorphism was associated with the sensation seeking personality trait in women only. The highest scores in the sensation-seeking scale and in three of the four subscales were observed in female subjects with the Val/Val genotype relative to women carrying the Met allele. Our results suggest that high COMT enzyme activity associated with the Val allele predisposes to high sensation seeking scores in female subjects and add to increasing evidence for a gender specific role of COMT in normal and dysfunctional behavior.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="76" length="9"></location><text>Val158Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4680</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15725393</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Supportive evidence for an allelic association of the human KCNJ10 potassium channel gene with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.		PURPOSE: Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in mice revealed a seizure-related QTL (Szs1), for which the inward-rectifying potassium channel Kcnj10 is the most compelling candidate gene. Association analysis of the human KCNJ10 gene identified a common KCNJ10 missense variation (Arg271Cys) that influences susceptibility to focal and generalized epilepsies. The present replication study tested the initial finding that the KCNJ10 Cys271 allele is associated with seizure resistance to common syndromes of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). METHODS: The study sample comprised 563 German IGE patients and 660 healthy population controls. To search for seizure type-specific effects, two IGE subgroups were formed, comprising 258 IGE patients with typical absences (IAE group) and 218 patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME group). A TaqMan nuclease assay was used to genotype the KCNJ10 single nucleotide polymorphism c.1037C &gt; T (dbSNP: rs1130183) that alters amino acid at position 271 from arginine to cysteine. RESULTS: Replication analysis revealed a significant decrease of the Cys271 allele frequency in 446 IGE patients compared to controls (chi2 = 3.52, d.f. = 1, P = 0.030, one-sided; OR(Cys271+) = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.50-0.95). Among the IGE subgroups, lack of the Cys271 allele was accentuated in the JME group (chi2 = 5.20, d.f. = 1, P = 0.011, one-sided).

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: HLA haplotypes DRB1*03_DQB1*02 and DRB1*04_DQB1*0302, and allelic variation of the T cell regulatory gene cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) and of the T cell activation gene protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (lymphoid) (PTPN22) have been associated with type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroid disease. Using thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPOAbs) as an indicator of thyroid autoimmunity, we assessed whether the association of these loci is different in type 1 diabetes patients with TPOAbs than in those without. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TPOAbs were measured in 4,364 type 1 diabetic patients from across Great Britain, 67% of whom were aged under 18 years. These patients and 6,866 geographically matched control subjects were genotyped at CTLA4, PTPN22, HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1. RESULTS: TPOAbs were detected in 462 (10.6%) of the type 1 diabetic patients. These patients had a stronger association with CTLA4 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.49 for the G allele of the single nucleotide polymorphism rs3087243; 95% CI = 1.29-1.72) than did the TPOAbs-negative patients (p = 0.0004; OR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.10-1.24) or type 1 diabetes patients overall (OR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.13-1.27). The ratio of women:men was higher (1.94:1) in this subgroup than in type 1 diabetes patients without TPOAbs (0.94:1; p = 1.86 x 10(-15)). TPOAbs status did not correlate with age at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or with PTPN22 (Arg620Trp; rs2476601). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results identify a subgroup of type 1 diabetic patients that is sensitive to allelic variation of the negative regulatory molecule CTLA-4 and indicate that TPOAbs testing could be used to subclassify type 1 diabetes patients for inclusion in genetic, biological or clinical studies.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1663" length="9"></location><text>Arg620Trp</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2476601</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17348446</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Nested case-control study of energy regulation candidate gene single nucleotide polymorphisms and breast cancer.		BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that energy regulation, particularly insulin resistance, may influence breast cancer risk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in energy regulation candidate genes and postmenopausal breast cancer risk were evaluated. Conditional logistic regression was run on 488 matched case-control pairs from the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort. The studied SNPs were INS+1127 PstI (rs3842752), INSR H1085H (rs1799817) and PPARy Prol2Ala (rs1801282). RESULTS: A significantly lower breast cancer risk was found among women homozygous for the T allele of INSR H1085H. A marginally significant increased risk of breast cancer was observed among women homozygous for the Ala allele of PPARgamma Pro12Ala. No significant association was observed between INS+ 1127 PstI and breast cancer risk. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that polymorphisms in these energy regulation candidate genes may be associated with risk of breast cancer, but replication in larger studies is needed.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="634" length="6"></location><text>H1085H</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="926" length="8"></location><text>Pro12Ala</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1799817</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1801282</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17606463</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Functional variants of interleukin-23 receptor gene confer risk for rheumatoid arthritis but not for systemic sclerosis.		OBJECTIVES: Recently, an association was found between Crohn's disease and the interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) gene. Since the IL-23/IL-17 pathway is known to associate with other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), we hypothesised that IL-23R could be a shared susceptibility gene. METHODS: Groups of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 412), systemic sclerosis (n = 224), Crohn's disease (n = 190) and healthy controls (n = 220) were genotyped for rs10889677 (exon-3'UTR C2370A), rs2201841, and rs1884444 variants; the first two have been shown to confer risk for Crohn's disease. RESULTS: We observed an increased prevalence of the homozygous rs10889677 AA and homozygous rs2201841 CC genotypes both in the Crohn's disease and in the RA groups as compared to the controls (12.1%, 11.9% vs 5.91%, p&lt;0.05; and 13.2%, 13.1% vs 5.91%, p&lt;0.05), but not in the SSc patients. Logistic regression analysis revealed that bearing these alleles represent risk for the development of rheumatoid arthritis (chi(2) = 5.58, p = 0.018, OR = 2.15, 95% CI 1.14-4.06 for rs10889677; and chi(2) = 7.45, p = 0.006, OR = 2.40, 95% CI 1.28-4.51 for rs2201841). The rs1884444 allele, which has been previously reported as neutral for development of Crohn's disease, was also found neutral for all studied groups in the present study. CONCLUSIONS: The data reported here provide direct evidence that some allelic variants or haplogroups of IL-23R represent independent risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis as well as Crohn's disease, but not for scleroderma.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="651" length="6"></location><text>C2370A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs10889677</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18252222</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A single SNP in an evolutionary conserved region within intron 86 of the HERC2 gene determines human blue-brown eye color.		We have previously demonstrated that haplotypes of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the first intron of the OCA2 gene are extremely strongly associated with variation in human eye color. In the present work, we describe additional fine association mapping of eye color SNPs in the intergenic region upstream of OCA2 and within the neighboring HERC2 (hect domain and RLD2) gene. We screened an additional 92 SNPs in 300-3000 European individuals and found that a single SNP in intron 86 of HERC2, rs12913832, predicted eye color significantly better (ordinal logistic regression R(2) = 0.68, association LOD = 444) than our previous best OCA2 haplotype. Comparison of sequence alignments of multiple species showed that this SNP lies in the center of a short highly conserved sequence and that the blue-eye-associated allele (frequency 78%) breaks up this conserved sequence, part of which forms a consensus binding site for the helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF). We were also able to demonstrate the OCA2 R419Q, rs1800407, coding SNP acts as a penetrance modifier of this new HERC2 SNP for eye color, and somewhat independently, of melanoma risk. We conclude that the conserved region around rs12913832 represents a regulatory region controlling constitutive expression of OCA2 and that the C allele at rs12913832 leads to decreased expression of OCA2, particularly within iris melanocytes, which we postulate to be the ultimate cause of blue eye color.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1156" length="5"></location><text>R419Q</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1800407</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17548681</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>MDR1 gene variants, indoor insecticide exposure, and the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.		OBJECTIVE: The multidrug resistance (MDR) 1 gene encodes a membrane transporter called P-glycoprotein, which plays an important role in protecting cells against lipophilic xenobiotics by way of an ATP-dependent cellular efflux mechanism. Among children enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study, we examined the susceptibility conferred by MDR1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and predicted haplotypes and whether they modify the association between indoor insecticide exposure and risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Buccal cell DNA from ALL cases (n = 294) and controls (n = 369) individually matched on gender, date of birth, Hispanic status, and maternal race were whole genome amplified and genotyped for four MDR1 SNPs, T-129C (rs3213619), C1236T (rs1128503), G2677T/A (rs2032582), and C3435T (rs1045642). Detailed and time-specific information on household pesticide use was obtained using in-home interviews with the mother. RESULTS: Allele frequencies in non-Hispanic White and Hispanic controls were similar, and with the exception of T-129C, seemed to be in strong linkage disequilibrium. Overall, the SNPs considered individually or within haplotypes (C1236T-G2677T/A-C3435T) were not significantly associated with childhood ALL. However, we observed strong evidence of a differential effect of indoor insecticide exposure (interaction odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-0.64; P = 0.025) on risk of ALL between carriers and noncarriers of haplotype CGC. CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that children carrying the haplotype CGC may be less susceptible to the leukemogenic effects of indoor insecticide exposures. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings.</text><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="884" length="6"></location><text>T-129C</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="904" length="6"></location><text>C1236T</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="924" length="6"></location><text>G2677T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="950" length="6"></location><text>C3435T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1128503</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1045642</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3213619</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2032582</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17006672</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Evidence for statistical epistasis between catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and polymorphisms in RGS4, G72 (DAOA), GRM3, and DISC1: influence on risk of schizophrenia.		Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) regulates dopamine degradation and is located in a genomic region that is deleted in a syndrome associated with psychosis, making it a promising candidate gene for schizophrenia. COMT also has been shown to influence prefrontal cortex processing efficiency. Prefrontal processing dysfunction is a common finding in schizophrenia, and a background of inefficient processing may modulate the effect of other candidate genes. Using the NIMH sibling study (SS), a non-independent case-control set, and an independent German (G) case-control set, we performed conditional/unconditional logistic regression to test for epistasis between SNPs in COMT (rs2097603, Val158Met (rs4680), rs165599) and polymorphisms in other schizophrenia susceptibility genes. Evidence for interaction was evaluated using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) between nested models. SNPs in RGS4, G72, GRM3, and DISC1 showed evidence for significant statistical epistasis with COMT. A striking result was found in RGS4: three of five SNPs showed a significant increase in risk [LRT P-values: 90387 = 0.05 (SS); SNP4 = 0.02 (SS), 0.02 (G); SNP18 = 0.04 (SS), 0.008 (G)] in interaction with COMT; main effects for RGS4 SNPs were null. Significant results for SNP4 and SNP18 were also found in the German study. We were able to detect statistical interaction between COMT and polymorphisms in candidate genes for schizophrenia, many of which had no significant main effect. In addition, we were able to replicate other studies, including allelic directionality. The use of epistatic models may improve replication of psychiatric candidate gene studies.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="864" length="9"></location><text>Val158Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4680</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17427196</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Monoamine oxidase A gene polymorphism predicts adolescent outcome of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.		ADHD is generally deemed to be a highly heritable disorder with mean heritability of 0.75. The enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO), which has both A and B types, has long been considered a candidate pathological substrate for ADHD, and more recently, the genes for both MAO enzymes have been examined as mediators of the illness. Previous studies indicated that 30-50% of children with ADHD will experience symptoms that persist into adolescence and will have more significant impairment in social and neuropsychological functioning compared to those whose symptoms have remitted. Genes may also influence these characteristics of the disorder, and in this context MAO genes may also be candidates for moderating the presentation of ADHD. The current study examined the association between adolescent outcome of ADHD and MAO gene polymorphisms, including the 941T &gt; G polymorphism in exon 8 (rs1799835) and 1460C &gt; T polymorphism in exon 14 (rs1137070) of the MAOA gene, and the A &gt; G polymorphism in intron13 (rs1799836), C &gt; T polymorphism in the 3'UTR (rs1040399), and 2327T &gt; C polymorphism in exon15 of the MAOB gene. Significant associations were observed between the MAOA gene polymorphisms and ADHD remission. Due to the small sample size and the possibility of phenotypic and etiologic heterogeneity of ADHD outcomes across ethnic or geographic groups, these results must be replicated before they can be generalized to other populations.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1014" length="9"></location><text>1460C &gt; T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="966" length="8"></location><text>941T &gt; G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1137070</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1799835</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16453988</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Daytime sleepiness and the COMT val158met polymorphism in patients with Parkinson disease.		STUDY OBJECTIVE: A preliminary study by our group suggested an association between daytime sleepiness and the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) val158met polymorphism (rs4680) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). We sought to confirm this association in a large group of patients with PD. DESIGN: Genetic association study in patients with PD. SETTING: Movement disorder sections at 2 university hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: PD patients with and without episodes of suddenly falling asleep matched for antiparkinsonian medication, disease duration, sex, and age, who participated in a previous genetic study on dopamine-receptor polymorphisms. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In this study, 240 patients with PD (154 men; age 65.1 +/- 6.1 years; disease duration 9.4 +/- 6.0 years) were included. Seventy had the met-met (LL), 116 the met-val (LH), and 54 the val-val (HH) genotype. In the combined LL+LH group (featuring reduced COMT activity), the mean Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score was 9.0 +/- 5.9 versus 11.0 +/- 6.1 in the HH (high COMT activity) group (P = .047). Forty-seven percent of the LL and LH patients had sudden sleep onset compared with 61% of the HH patients (P = .07). Logistic regression, however, showed that both pathologic ESS scores (i.e., &gt; 10) and sudden sleep onset were predicted by subjective disease severity (P &lt; .001 each) but not by the COMT genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our previous finding that the L-allele may be associated with daytime sleepiness could not be confirmed in the present study. Altogether, our data do not support a clinically relevant effect of the COMT genotype on daytime sleepiness in PD.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="32" length="9"></location><text>val158met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4680</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17877509</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Heterozygosity for IL23R p.Arg381Gln confers a protective effect not only against Crohn's disease but also ulcerative colitis.		BACKGROUND: A recent study reported that a non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (rs11209026, p.Arg381Gln) located in the IL23R gene is a protective marker for inflammatory bowel disease. AIM: To analyse the frequency of p.Arg381Gln in three independent European inflammatory bowel disease cohorts and to evaluate how this variant influences disease behaviour. METHODS: We assessed a European cohort of 919 inflammatory bowel disease patients and compared the IL23R p.Arg381Gln genotype frequency with 845 healthy controls. Inflammatory bowel disease patients originated from Germany [Crohn's disease (CD): n = 318; ulcerative colitis (UC): n = 178], Hungary (CD: n = 148; UC: n = 118) and the Netherlands (CD: n = 157). Ethnically matched controls were included. We performed subtyping analysis in respect to CARD15 alterations and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The frequency of the glutamine allele of p.Arg381Gln was significantly lower in inflammatory bowel disease patients compared with controls in a pooled analysis of all three cohorts (P &lt; 0.000001) as well as in the individual cohorts (Germany: P = 0.001, Hungary: P = 0.02 and the Netherlands: P = 0.0002). The p.Arg381Gln genotype distribution was similar between CD and UC. We did not observe either statistical interactions between p.Arg381Gln and CARD15 variants or any significant associations between p.Arg381Gln genotype and subphenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The p.Arg381Gln IL23R variant confers a protective effect against both CD and UC, but does not determine disease phenotype.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="25" length="11"></location><text>p.Arg381Gln</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11209026</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15878916</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic polymorphisms of p21 are associated with risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.		The p21 (Waf1/Cip1/CDKN1A) protein regulates the transition from the G1 to the S phase and has an important role in modulating cell-cycle control, apoptosis and cell growth. Two polymorphisms of the p21 gene at codon 31 (p21 C98A, dbSNP rs1801270) and at the 3' untranslated region (p21 T70C, dbSNP rs1059234) may have an effect on the protein function and may thus play a role in the development of cancer. We hypothesized that these two p21 polymorphisms are associated with the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). We tested this hypothesis in a hospital-based case-control study of 712 patients newly diagnosed with SCCHN and 1222 cancer-free controls who were frequency-matched by age, sex and ethnicity. All subjects were non-Hispanic whites. Our results showed that the variant alleles and genotypes were more common among cases than among controls (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.013 for p21C70T, and P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.035 for p21C98A, respectively). Compared with the p21 70CC genotype, there was a significantly greater risk of SCCHN associated with the variant p21 70TC [odds ratio (OR) = 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12-1.93] and combined p21 70TC/TT (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.14-1.95) genotypes. Similarly, compared with the p21 98CC genotype, there was also a significantly greater SCCHN risk associated with the variant p21 98AC (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.00-1.73) and combined p21 98AC/AA (OR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.05-1.79) genotypes. When these two polymorphisms were evaluated together by the number of risk alleles, there was a significant increase in SCCHN risk that was dependent on the number of risk alleles (P(trend) = 0.001). Our results suggest that the presence of these two p21 polymorphisms may be a marker of genetic susceptibility to SCCHN.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="329" length="4"></location><text>C98A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="391" length="4"></location><text>T70C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1801270</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1059234</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16753056</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>The functional "KL-VS" variant of KLOTHO is not associated with type 2 diabetes in 5028 UK Caucasians.		BACKGROUND: Klotho has an important role in insulin signalling and the development of ageing-like phenotypes in mice. The common functional "KL-VS" variant in the KLOTHO (KL) gene is associated with longevity in humans but its role in type 2 diabetes is not known. We performed a large case-control and family-based study to test the hypothesis that KL-VS is associated with type 2 diabetes in a UK Caucasian population. METHODS: We genotyped 1793 cases, 1619 controls and 1616 subjects from 509 families for the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) F352V (rs9536314) that defines the KL-VS variant. Allele and genotype frequencies were compared between cases and controls. Family-based analysis was used to test for over- or under-transmission of V352 to affected offspring. RESULTS: Despite good power to detect odds ratios of 1.2, there were no significant associations between alleles or genotypes and type 2 diabetes (V352 allele: odds ratio = 0.96 (0.84-1.09)). Additional analysis of quantitative trait data in 1177 healthy control subjects showed no association of the variant with fasting insulin, glucose, triglycerides, HDL- or LDL-cholesterol (all P &gt; 0.05). However, the HDL-cholesterol levels observed across the genotype groups showed a similar, but non-significant, pattern to previously reported data. CONCLUSION: This is the first large-scale study to examine the association between common functional variation in KL and type 2 diabetes risk. We have found no evidence that the functional KL-VS variant is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes in a large UK Caucasian case-control and family-based study.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="654" length="5"></location><text>F352V</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs9536314</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18222355</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Polymorphism in KIF6 gene and benefit from statins after acute coronary syndromes: results from the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study.		OBJECTIVES: We explored whether the benefit of intensive versus moderate statin therapy would be greater in carriers of KIF6 719Arg than in noncarriers. BACKGROUND: The 719Arg variant of Trp719Arg (rs20455), a polymorphism in kinesin-like protein 6, is associated with greater risk of coronary events and greater benefit from pravastatin versus placebo. METHODS: We genotyped 1,778 acute coronary syndrome patients within the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 (Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy: Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22) trial and investigated different intensities of statin therapy in carriers of 719Arg and in noncarriers using Cox proportional hazards models that adjusted for traditional risk factors. RESULTS: Benefit from intensive, compared with moderate, statin therapy was significantly greater in the 59% of the cohort who were carriers (hazard ratio [HR] 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45 to 0.77) than in those who were noncarriers (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.27; p = 0.018 for interaction between 719Arg carrier status and treatment). Absolute risk reduction was 10.0% in carriers versus 0.8% in noncarriers. The benefit of intensive therapy in carriers was significant as early as day 30 of therapy. Carriers and noncarriers did not differ in on-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. CONCLUSIONS: Carriers of 719Arg receive significantly greater benefit from intensive statin therapy than do noncarriers, a superior benefit that appears to be due to a mechanism distinct from lipid or CRP lowering. Functional studies of the KIF6 kinesin are warranted, given the consistent association of Trp719Arg with risk of coronary events and statin benefit.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="312" length="9"></location><text>Trp719Arg</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs20455</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17519222</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Non-synonymous polymorphisms in melanocortin-4 receptor protect against obesity: the two facets of a Janus obesity gene.

We observed a consistent negative association of I251L variant (prevalence ranging 0.41-1.21%) with both childhood and adult class III obesity [odds ratio (OR) ranging from 0.25 to 0.76, 0.001 &lt; P-value &lt; 0.05] and with modulation of body mass index (BMI) in general populations, in eight out of nine studies, whereas only one study showed an association between V103I and BMI. Meta-analyses of previous published data with the current ones provided strong evidence of the protective effect of I251L toward obesity (OR = 0.52, P = 3.58 10-5), together with a modest negative association between V103I and obesity (OR = 0.80, P = 0.002). Taken together, gain-of-function mutations I251L and V103I may be responsible for a preventive fraction of obesity of 2%, which mirrors the prevalence of monogenic obesity due to MC4R haploinsufficiency. These results also emphasize the importance of the MC4R signalling tonus to prevent obesity, even in the context of our current obesogenic environment.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="409" length="10"></location><text>c.307G &gt; A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="391" length="5"></location><text>V103I</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2229616</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2229616</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17000021</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>No independent role of the -1123 G&gt;C and+2740 A&gt;G variants in the association of PTPN22 with type 1 diabetes and juvenile idiopathic arthritis in two Caucasian populations.		INTRODUCTION: The PTPN22 is a negative regulator of the T cell response. Its +1858C&gt;T (R620W) polymorphism has been shown to associate with a risk for multiple autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The minor (susceptibility) allele is absent in Asian populations, but a recent study suggested an independent involvement of another polymorphism located within the promoter -1123 nucleotides relative to the translational start site. AIMS: We aimed to analyse the association of three PTPN22 polymorphisms in two distinct Caucasian populations, the Czechs (with T1D and with JIA) and Azeri (with T1D). METHODS: The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at positions -1123 (rs2488457), +1858 (rs2476601, the R620W substitution), and +2740 (rs1217412) were genotyped using TaqMan assays in 372 subjects with childhood-onset T1D, 130 subjects with JIA, and 400 control subjects of Czech origin, and in 160 subjects with T1D and 271 healthy controls of Azeri origin. RESULTS: In the Czechs, all three SNPs were in a tight linkage disequlibrium, while in the Azeri, the linkage disequlibrium was limited to between the promoter and 3'-UTR polymorphism, D'(-1123, +2740)=0.99, r(2)=0.72. Haplotype reconstruction via the expectation-maximization algorithm showed in both populations that only the haplotype containing the minor (W) allele at codon 620 was associated with T1D (OR=2.26, 95% CI 1.68-3.02 in Czechs, OR=14.8, 95% CI 2.0-651 in Azeri) or JIA (OR=2.43, 95% CI 1.66-3.56 in Czechs). The haplotypes having the wild-type (R) allele at codon 620 and minor alleles at -1123 and/or +2740 were neutral as to the risk of autoimmune conditions in both populations. CONCLUSIONS: In two different Caucasian populations, the Czechs and the Azeri, no independent contribution can be detected either of the -1123 promoter SNP or the +2740 3'-UTR SNP, and only the minor allele at PTPN22 codon 620 contributes to the risk of autoimmunity.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="27" length="9"></location><text>-1123 G&gt;C</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="261" length="5"></location><text>R620W</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="252" length="7"></location><text>1858C&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2488457</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2476601</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2476601</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17615386</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>IL13 promoter polymorphism 1112C/T modulates the adverse effect of tobacco smoking on lung function.		RATIONALE: Although the duration and amount of cigarette smoking correlate with reduction in pulmonary function, there is still variation among individual responses. IL-13 is involved in pulmonary inflammation, remodeling, and susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether the relationships between smoking and the lung function measures FEV(1) and FEV(1)/FVC ratio are modulated by IL13 polymorphisms. METHODS: Smokers (&gt;or=20 pack-years), aged at least 40 years old (n = 1,073), were genotyped for three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; -1112C/T [rs1800925], +2044G/A [rs20541, R130Q], and +2525G/A [rs1295685]) in the IL13 gene. Linear, quantile, and logistic regression methods were used to assess the effect of cigarette smoking (pack-years), IL13 polymorphisms, and their interaction on %predicted FEV(1) and FEV(1)/FVC ratio. Age, sex, and current smoking status were included as confounders. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The number of pack-years smoked was associated with a lower value for both %predicted FEV(1) and FEV(1)/FVC (P &lt; 0.001). The three SNPs were not associated with lung function measures; however, there was a significant combined effect between smoking and the promoter polymorphism -1112C/T on %predicted FEV(1) (P for interaction &lt; 0.03 for mean %predicted FEV(1) and &lt; 0.0001 for 90th percentile %predicted FEV(1)). Every 20-pack-year increment in smoking was associated with a 2.4% reduction in mean %predicted FEV(1) in the common homozygous (CC) or heterozygous (CT) promoter genotypes, and an 8.2% reduction in mean %predicted FEV(1) in minor allele homozygotes (TT, recessive model). CONCLUSIONS: An IL13 polymorphism in the promoter region may modulate the adverse effects of cigarette smoking on pulmonary function in long-term cigarette smokers.</text><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="742" length="5"></location><text>R130Q</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="701" length="8"></location><text>-1112C/T</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="755" length="7"></location><text>2525G/A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="724" length="7"></location><text>2044G/A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1800925</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs20541</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs20541</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1295685</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17894849</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>IL23R R381Q and ATG16L1 T300A are strongly associated with Crohn's disease in a study of New Zealand Caucasians with inflammatory bowel disease.		OBJECTIVE: Recently, separate genome-wide association analyses have identified nonsynonymous SNPs in IL23R and ATG16L1 (rs11209026; c1142G&gt;A, R381Q, and rs2241880; c1338A&gt;G, T300A, respectively) as strong candidate susceptibility factors for Crohn's disease (CD) in whites. The aim of our study was to test whether these SNPs are associated with CD in a population-based cohort of New Zealand Caucasian inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. METHODS: Allele frequencies of rs11209026 and rs2241880 were determined in 496 CD patients, 466 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 591 controls. Distribution of the relevant alleles was compared between controls and IBD patients. rs11209026 and rs2241880 genotype distributions were examined both within IBD clinical subphenotypes and CARD15 genotypes. RESULTS: rs11209026 and rs2241880 were both associated with CD (P valuers11209026=0.0026, OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36-0.81; P valuers2241880=0.0001, OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.18-1.67). In addition, there was evidence for association of rs11209026 with UC (P value=0.037, OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45-0.98). No significant association was observed between IL23R genotype or ATG16L1 genotype and IBD subphenotypes. IL23R was associated with CD and UC only in the absence of CARD15 mutations, whereas ATG16L1 was associated with CD in the presence and absence of CARD15 mutations. CONCLUSIONS: We replicated the previously reported associations between CD and rs11209026 and rs2241880, confirming that IL23R and ATG16L1 are susceptibility loci for CD in the New Zealand population. We also provide further evidence for association of rs11209026 with UC and a report of an additive effect between IL23R and CARD15 genotypes in CD.</text><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="320" length="5"></location><text>T300A</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="278" length="8"></location><text>c1142G&gt;A</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="6" length="5"></location><text>R381Q</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="310" length="8"></location><text>c1338A&gt;G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11209026</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2241880</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2241880</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11209026</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17286247</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Positive association of the Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 gene (DISC1) with schizophrenia in the Chinese Han population.		Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) is located on 1q42.1, one of the most promising susceptibility loci in schizophrenia linkage studies. A non-synonymous genetic variation rs821616 (Ser704Cys) in DISC1, has recently been shown to be associated with schizophrenia in family-based study [Callicott et al. (2005); Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102: 8627-8632]. In order to further confirm this issue, we examined four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a chromosomal region spanning 42 kb of this gene, namely rs821616, rs821597, rs4658971, and rs843979, in Chinese sample of 313 schizophrenia patients and 317 healthy controls. Our results showed that two SNPs had strong associations with schizophrenia (rs821616: Allele A &gt; T, chi(2) = 7.8006, df = 1, P = 0.0052; Genotype, chi(2) = 7.7935, df = 2, P = 0.0203; rs821597: Allele A &gt; G, chi(2) = 9.5404, df = 1, P = 0.0020; Genotype, chi(2) = 12.2780, df = 2, P = 0.0022). When haplotypes were constructed with two, three, and four markers, a number of haplotype combinations, especially those including rs821616 and rs821597, were significantly associated with schizophrenia. Furthermore, there was a strong evidence for association in a four-marker haplotype analysis (chi(2) = 7.686, df = 4, P = 0.005581, corrected P = 0.006199). Although the case-control and family-based association studies both suggest that DISC1 gene may play a role in genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia, the risk haplotypic combinations have subtle differences in the two studies. Our findings provide further evidence for DISC1 as a predisposing gene involved in schizophrenia in the Chinese Han Population.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="305" length="9"></location><text>Ser704Cys</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs821616</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17917281</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>No association of the G1287A polymorphism in the norepinephrine transporter gene and susceptibility to major depressive disorder in a Japanese population.		Norepinephrinergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system have a major impact on the symptomatology in major depressive disorder (MDD), and genetic polymorphisms of norepinephrine transporter (NET) have a possibility to be involved in susceptibility to MDD. We investigated the association of the G1287A (rs5569) polymorphism of the NET gene and susceptibility to MDD by comparing 145 major depressive patients with 164 healthy individuals first in a Japanese population. The genotype frequencies in depressed patients and health volunteers of the NET G1287A polymorphism were 52.4% (G/G), 39.3% (G/A) and 8.3% (A/A) in depressed patients, 61.6% (G/G), 29.9% (G/A allele) and 8.5% (A/A) in healthy volunteers, respectively. The allele frequencies in depressed patients and health volunteers of the NET G1287A polymorphism were 72.1% (G allele) and 27.9% (A allele) in depressed patients, 76.5% (G allele) and 23.5% (A allele) in healthy volunteers, respectively. The genotype distribution and allele frequencies were not significantly different between major depressive patients and healthy volunteers. NET G1287A polymorphism appears not to be an important factor in susceptibility to MDD in a Japanese population.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="22" length="6"></location><text>G1287A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5569</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16691626</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism in the PDZ-Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Ser1416Gly) modulates the risk of lung cancer in Mexican Americans.		BACKGROUND: Based on in vitro studies, Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs) are key regulators of mitogenic and transforming pathways. At least 1 family member, PDZ-RhoGEF, also integrates signaling between monomeric Rho G proteins and heterotrimeric G proteins through a so-called regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) domain. Recently, the authors reported that 3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2 members of the RGS family were associated with significant reductions in the risk of cancer. METHODS: For the current report, the authors studied the risk of lung cancer associated with a nonsynonymous SNP (rs868188; Ser1416Gly) in PDZ-RhoGEF in a large lung cancer case-control study of 2260 Caucasians and 369 Mexican Americans. RESULTS: Compared with individuals who had the wild-type genotype (AA), Mexican Americans with the variant genotypes (AG and GG) had a significantly reduced risk for lung cancer (odds ratio [OR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 0.34-0.94). The protective effect appeared to be more evident in younger individuals (OR, 0.42; 95%CI, 0.20-0.91), men (OR, 0.36; 95%CI, 0.18-0.71), and ever smokers (OR, 0.50; 95%CI, 0.29-0.88). A joint effect was observed between Ser1416Gly and polymorphisms in 2 cell-cycle control genes: p53 (intron 3) and cyclin D1 (CCND1). Tallying the variant alleles of the 4 RGS gene SNPs, a gene-dosage effect was apparent. Compared with individuals who had &lt; 3 variant alleles, patients with &gt; or = 3 variant alleles had a 51% reduction in lung cancer risk (OR, 0.49; 95%CI, 0.28-0.88). CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first epidemiological study to link PDZ-RhoGEF polymorphisms with cancer risk. The results suggest that there are interactions between RGS2, RGS6, and PDZ-RhoGEF and validate this family of proteins as key regulators of tumorigenesis.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="98" length="10"></location><text>Ser1416Gly</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs868188</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16954131</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Toll-like receptor 4 gene polymorphisms and myocardial infarction: no association in a Caucasian population.		AIMS: The toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is predominantly known for its role as an important mediator of immune reactions and has been implicated in the initiation, progression, and plaque destabilization stages of atherosclerosis. We investigated whether genotypes and haplotypes of the 896A/G (Asp299Gly; rs4986790) and 1196C/T (Thr399Ile; rs4986791) single nucleotide polymorphisms of the gene encoding the TLR4 were associated with myocardial infarction (MI) in a large Caucasian sample. METHODS AND RESULTS: The case group included 3657 patients with MI and the control group comprised 1211 individuals with angiographically normal coronary arteries and without signs or symptoms of MI. Genotypes were determined with the use of TaqMan assays. Genotype distributions of the 896A/G and 1196C/T polymorphisms were not significantly different between the control and patient groups (P&gt; or =0.30). The frequencies of haplotypes defined by the 896A/G and 1196C/T polymorphisms were similar between the control group and the patient group (P&gt; or =0.16). In addition, the distributions of haplotype-defined genotypes (diplotypes) were not significantly different between the control group and the patient group (P&gt; or =0.12). Separate analyses in women and men did not reveal sex-related associations of specific genotypes or haplotypes of the polymorphisms with MI (P&gt; or =0.11). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the 896A/G and 1196C/T polymorphisms of the TLR4 gene or haplotypes based on these polymorphisms are not associated with MI.</text><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="438" length="9"></location><text>Thr399Ile</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="429" length="7"></location><text>1196C/T</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="403" length="9"></location><text>Asp299Gly</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="395" length="6"></location><text>896A/G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4986791</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4986790</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4986791</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4986790</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17932347</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Polymorphisms in apoptosis- and proliferation-related genes, ionizing radiation exposure, and risk of breast cancer among U.S. Radiologic Technologists.		BACKGROUND: Although genes involved in apoptosis pathways and DNA repair pathways are both essential for maintaining genomic integrity, genetic variants in DNA repair have been thought to increase susceptibility to radiation carcinogenesis, but similar hypotheses have not generally been raised about apoptosis genes. For this reason, potential modification of the relationship between ionizing radiation exposure and breast cancer risk by polymorphic apoptosis gene variants have not been investigated among radiation-exposed women. METHODS: In a case-control study of 859 cases and 1,083 controls within the U.S. Radiologic Technologists cohort, we assessed breast cancer risk with respect to 16 candidate variants in eight genes involved in apoptosis, inflammation, and proliferation. Using carefully reconstructed cumulative breast dose estimates from occupational and personal diagnostic ionizing radiation, we also investigated the joint effects of these polymorphisms on the risk of breast cancer. RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, we observed a significantly decreased risk of breast cancer associated with the homozygous minor allele of CASP8 D302H [rs1045485, odds ratio (OR), 0.3; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.1-0.8]. We found a significantly increased breast cancer risk with increasing minor alleles for IL1A A114S (rs17561); heterozygote OR 1.2 (95% CI, 1.0-1.4) and homozygote OR 1.5 (95% CI, 1.1-2.0), P(trend) = 0.008. Assuming a dominant genetic model, IL1A A114S significantly modified the dose-response relationship between cumulative personal diagnostic radiation and breast cancer risk, adjusted for occupational dose (P(interaction) = 0.004). CONCLUSION: The U.S. Radiologic Technologists breast cancer study provided a unique opportunity to examine the joint effects of common genetic variation and ionizing radiation exposure to the breast using detailed occupational and personal diagnostic dose data. We found evidence of effect modification of the radiation and breast cancer dose-response relationship that should be confirmed in studies with more cases and controls and quantified radiation breast doses in the low-to-moderate range.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1484" length="5"></location><text>A114S</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1307" length="5"></location><text>D302H</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs17561</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1045485</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17203305</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic variation in the base excision repair pathway and bladder cancer risk.		Genetic polymorphisms in DNA repair genes may impact individual variation in DNA repair capacity and alter cancer risk. In order to examine the association of common genetic variation in the base-excision repair (BER) pathway with bladder cancer risk, we analyzed 43 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 12 BER genes (OGG1, MUTYH, APEX1, PARP1, PARP3, PARP4, XRCC1, POLB, POLD1, PCNA, LIG1, and LIG3). Using genotype data from 1,150 cases of urinary bladder transitional cell carcinomas and 1,149 controls from the Spanish Bladder Cancer Study we estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) adjusting for age, gender, region and smoking status. SNPs in three genes showed significant associations with bladder cancer risk: the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase gene (OGG1), the Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase family member 1 (PARP1) and the major gap filling polymerase-beta (POLB). Subjects who were heterozygous or homozygous variant for an OGG1 SNP in the promoter region (rs125701) had significantly decreased bladder cancer risk compared to common homozygous: OR (95%CI) 0.78 (0.63-0.96). Heterozygous or homozygous individuals for the functional SNP PARP1 rs1136410 (V762A) or for the intronic SNP POLB rs3136717 were at increased risk compared to those homozygous for the common alleles: 1.24 (1.02-1.51) and 1.30 (1.04-1.62), respectively. In summary, data from this large case-control study suggested bladder cancer risk associations with selected BER SNPs, which need to be confirmed in other study populations.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1264" length="5"></location><text>V762A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1136410</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17083349</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Interaction between variants in the interleukin-4 receptor alpha and interleukin-9 receptor genes in childhood wheezing: evidence from a birth cohort study.		BACKGROUND: Several polymorphisms in the IL-4 receptor alpha (IL4RA) gene have been associated with asthma and atopy, but with variable success in different populations. Immunologic studies suggest that IL4RA may interact with other cytokines and receptors, and gene-gene interactions have also been observed with respect to asthma. Such interactions have been proposed to explain partly the difficulties in replicating association studies. METHODS: Using the prospective birth cohort BAMSE, we examined eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and corresponding haplotypes in the IL4RA gene in relation to wheezing and sensitization up to age 4. We also evaluated potential interaction effects (departure from a multiplicative interaction model) between the IL4RA SNPs and four SNPs in the IL-9 receptor (IL9R) gene previously associated with childhood wheezing. RESULTS: We found no main effect of the IL4RA SNPs alone and only weak associations to wheezing and sensitization when haplotypes were considered. Gene-gene interactions between several IL4RA and IL9R SNPs with regard to wheezing were observed (P=0.009), especially between IL4RA Q576R (rs1801275) and IL9R rs731476 (P=0.005). An interaction was also seen between IL4RA and IL9R haplotypes. CONCLUSION: Variants in the IL4RA gene alone may not exert any major influence on susceptibility to asthma-related diseases in childhood, but in combination with other genes, such as IL9R, IL4RA may be an important gene for disease susceptibility.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1306" length="5"></location><text>Q576R</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1801275</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16859551</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Common variations in ALG9 are not associated with bipolar I disorder: a family-based study.		BACKGROUND: A mannosyltransferase gene (ALG9, DIBD1) at chromosome band 11q23 was previously identified to be disrupted by a balanced chromosomal translocation t(9;11)(p24;q23) co-segregating with bipolar affective disorder in a small family. Inborn ALG9 deficiency (congenital disorders of glycosylation type IL) is associated with progressive microcephaly, seizures, developmental delay, and hepatomegaly. It is unknown whether common variations of ALG9 predispose to bipolar affective disorder. METHODS: We tested five polymorphic markers spanning ALG9 (three intragenic and one upstream microsatellite repeats and one common missense variation, V289I (rs10502151) for their association with bipolar I disorder in two pedigree series. The NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) pedigrees had a total of 166 families showing transmissions to 250 affected offspring, whereas The PITT (The University of Pittsburgh) pedigrees had a total of 129 families showing transmissions to 135 cases. We used transmission disequilibrium test for the association analyses. RESULTS: We identified three common and distinct haplotypes spanning the ALG9 gene. We found no statistically-significant evidence of transmission disequilibrium of marker alleles or multi-marker haplotypes to the affected offspring with bipolar I disorder. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that common variations in ALG9 do not play a major role in predisposition to bipolar affective disorder.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="742" length="5"></location><text>V289I</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs10502151</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17960769</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Type 2 diabetes-associated fatty acid binding protein 2 promoter haplotypes are differentially regulated by GATA factors.		The human intestinal fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2) mediates fat absorption by binding and intracellular trafficking of long-chain free fatty acids. Studies with knockout mice and association analysis of polymorphisms revealed that FABP2 is a susceptibility gene for type 2 diabetes (noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]) and related traits. Relevant FABP2 promoter polymorphisms c.-80_-79insT (rs5861422), c.-136_-132delAGTAG (rs5861423), c.-168_-166delAAGinsT (rs1973598), c.-260G&gt;A (rs6857641), c.-471G&gt;A (rs2282688), and c.-778G&gt;T (rs10034579) result in two haplotypes A and B, whereby B possesses two- to three-fold lower transcriptional activity than A. We show in luciferase reporter gene assays by a series of chimeric FABP2 promoter constructs in intestinal Caco-2 cells that polymorphism c.-80_-79insT essentially determines different activities of the FABP2 promoter. In accordance, in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), transcriptional factors GATA-5 and -6 bind with higher binding affinities to the FABP2 promoter region containing the -80A allele compared to B. As functional consequence, haplotype A is twice as much more activated by GATA factors than haplotype B in liver Huh7 cells. Additionally, a construct bearing the -80B allele in the background of haplotype A reversed the activity from A to B. Thus, the GATA mediated differential activation of FABP2 haplotypes depends on polymorphism c.-80_-79insT. This provides the molecular basis for the variant specific transcriptional regulation of the diabetes type 2-associated FABP2 gene.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="614" length="9"></location><text>c.-260G&gt;A</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="664" length="9"></location><text>c.-778G&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="637" length="9"></location><text>c.-471G&gt;A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6857641</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2282688</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs10034579</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16854283</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Single nucleotide polymorphism and haplotype in TBX1 gene of patients with conotruncal defects: analysis of 130 cases		OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites in TBX1 gene and the distribution of related haplotypes in the patients with conotruncal defects (CTD) and normal people. METHODS: The genotypes of the 3 selected SNPs: G2857C (rs737868), G2963A (rs28649236), and A6571T (rs28939675) in TBX1 gene were analyzed by PCR-RFLP among 130 patients with CTD and 200 normal people. Contingency table was applied to analyze the frequencies of these SNP genotypes and related alleles. PHASE software was used to construct the haplotypes and analyze the haplotype frequencies in these 2 groups. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the allele frequency and genotype rates of the SNPs G2587C and A6571T between the CTD patients and normal controls (all P &gt; 0.05). However, the allele frequency and genotype rates of the SNP G2963A were significant different between he CTD patients and normal controls: the G allele frequency in the CTD patients was 53.8%, significantly higher than that in the normal controls (42.5%, chi(2) = 8.14, P &lt; 0.005); and the AA genotype rate of the CTD patients was 21.6%, significantly lower than that of the controls (38.0%), and the GA genotype rate in the CTD patients was 49.2%, significantly higher than that in the controls (39.0%) (both chi(2) = 9.9, P &lt; 0.05). The haplotype frequencies of G2587/G2963/A6571 and G2587/A2963/T6571 of the CTD patients were 49.2% and 14.6% respectively, both significantly higher than those of the normal controls (36.3% and 9.5% respectively), and the haplotype frequencies of G2587/G2963/T6571 and G2587/A2963/A6571 in the CTD patients were 34.6% and 3% respectively, both significantly lower than those in the normal controls (48.3% and 18% respectively) (chi(2) = 22.39, P &lt; 0.005). CONCLUSION: The SNP site G2963A located in the coding-region of TBX1 gene is associated with CTD. The persons with G2963 have higher risk of CTD than those with A2963. The haplotypes constructed with these 3 SNP sites may be linked with the susceptibility gene of CTD.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="425" length="6"></location><text>A6571T</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1943" length="6"></location><text>G2963A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="381" length="6"></location><text>G2857C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs28939675</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs737868</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs28649236</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15457498</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Mutation screen of the brain derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF): identification of several genetic variants and association studies in patients with obesity, eating disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.		Several lines of evidence indicate an involvement of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in body weight regulation and activity: heterozygous Bdnf knockout mice (Bdnf(+/-)) are hyperphagic, obese, and hyperactive; furthermore, central infusion of BDNF leads to severe, dose-dependent appetite suppression and weight loss in rats. We searched for the role of BDNF variants in obesity, eating disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A mutation screen (SSCP and DHPLC) of the translated region of BDNF in 183 extremely obese children and adolescents and 187 underweight students was performed. Additionally, we genotyped two common polymorphisms (rs6265: p.V66M; c.-46C &gt; T) in 118 patients with anorexia nervosa, 80 patients with bulimia nervosa, 88 patients with ADHD, and 96 normal weight controls. Three rare variants (c.5C &gt; T: p.T2I; c.273G &gt; A; c.*137A &gt; G) and the known polymorphism (p.V66M) were identified. A role of the I2 allele in the etiology of obesity cannot be excluded.

Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is essential for transcription and replication of mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Disturbance of maintenance of mtDNA integrity or mitochondrial function may underlay neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD). TFAM, the gene encoding TFAM maps to chromosome 10q21.1, a region that showed linkage to late-onset AD in several study samples. We screened TFAM for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genotyped the G&gt;C SNP rs1937, coding for S12T in mitochondrial signal sequence of TFAM, and the A&gt;G SNP rs2306604 (IVS4+113A&gt;G) in 372 AD patients and 295 nondemented control subjects. There was an association of genotype rs1937G/G with AD in females and an association of a TFAM haplotype with AD both in the whole sample and in females.

Mutations in the LMNA gene, encoding the nuclear envelope protein lamin A/C, are responsible for a number of distinct disease entities including Dunnigan-type familial partial lipodystrophy. Dunningan-type lipodystrophy is characterized by loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes and shares many of the features of the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, several genome-wide linkage scans for type 2 diabetes have found evidence of linkage at chromosome 1q21.2, the region that harbors the LMNA gene. Therefore, LMNA is a biological and positional candidate for type 2 diabetes susceptibility. Previous studies have reported association between a common LMNA variant (1908C&gt;T; rs4641) and adverse metabolic traits in ethnically diverse populations from Asia and North America. In the present study, we characterized the common variation across the LMNA gene (including rs4641) and tested for association with type 2 diabetes in two large case-control studies (n = 2,052) and with features of the metabolic syndrome in a separate cohort study (n = 1,572). Despite our study being sufficiently powered to detect effects similar and even smaller in magnitude than those previously reported, none of the LMNA single nucleotide polymorphisms were statistically significantly associated with type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. Thus, it appears unlikely that variation at LMNA substantially increases the risk of type 2 diabetes or related traits in U.K. Europids.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="832" length="7"></location><text>1908C&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4641</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16120485</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of variation in expression of autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type 2: searching for modifier genes.		INTRODUCTION: Autosomal Dominant Osteopetrosis type II (ADO2) is a heritable osteosclerotic disorder that results from heterozygous mutations in the ClCN7 gene. Analysis of ADO2 in our pedigrees indicates that the penetrance is 66%, with a highly variable phenotype. METHODS: To identify genes that modify disease status, we performed a 10 cM genome-wide scan using 400 microsatellite markers in 112 subjects from our 8 largest ADO2 families with mutations in the ClCN7 gene. Results were analyzed by parametric linkage analysis using autosomal dominant and recessive models for affects on disease status. Follow-up genotyping with additional microsatellite markers was performed for regions with LOD scores over 1.5. In addition, we compared the frequency of two nonsynonymous SNPs, rs12926089 (V418M) and rs11559208 (K691E), and one promoter SNP rs960467 in the normal ClCN7 allele between a sample of unaffected gene carriers and clinically affected subjects to test the hypothesis that genetic variation in the non-disease allele within the ClCN7 gene might influence disease expression. RESULTS: We found potential evidence of linkage for a modifier gene(s) on 9q21-22 with a LOD score of 1.89, which is not statistically significant, but interesting. We also found that, for SNP V418M on the non-disease allele with the wild-type ClCN7 sequence, 94.92% (56/59) of clinically affected subjects and 78.13% (25/32) of unaffected gene carriers had a valine while 5.08% (3/59) of the affected subjects and 21.88% (7/32) of unaffected gene carriers had a methionine (P &lt; 0.03). Unfortunately, SNP K691E was not informative in our families. For SNP rs960467, on the non-disease allele with the wild-type ClCN7 gene, 87.93% (51/58) of clinically affected subjects and 62.50% (20/32) of unaffected gene carriers had a C allele while 12.07% (7/58) of the clinically affected subjects and 37.50% (12/32) of unaffected gene carriers had a T allele (P &lt; 0.007). As expected, the polymorphisms on the disease allele were not associated with disease status. CONCLUSIONS: Chromosome 9q21-22 may harbor a modifier gene(s) that affect(s) ADO2 disease status and severity. Additionally, we find the associations between the polymorphisms on the non-disease allele and unaffected gene carrier status.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="930" length="5"></location><text>K691E</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="907" length="5"></location><text>V418M</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11559208</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs12926089</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>12600718</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>ABCA1 modulates CSF cholesterol levels and influences the age at onset of Alzheimer's disease.		Increased formation of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is a central event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). High cellular cholesterol load promotes Abeta formation. The ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) mediates cholesterol efflux from cells. We hypothesized that genetic variability in ABCA1 may influence cholesterol metabolism in the central nervous system (CNS) and, thus, interfere with the development of AD. Healthy elderly carriers of the A allele of a non-synonymous (R219K) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the ABCA1 gene (rs2234884) had on average 33% lower total cholesterol in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than non-carriers. In 169 patients with late onset, sporadic AD, this allele was associated with delayed age at onset of the disease by 1.7 years on average. Rs2234884 and another non-synonymous SNP (R1587K) in ABCA1 (rs2234886) failed to show significant association with the risk for AD. We conclude that genetic variability of ABCA1 influences the development of AD, possibly by interfering with CNS cholesterol homeostasis.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="945" length="6"></location><text>R1587K</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="599" length="5"></location><text>R219K</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2230808</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2230806</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17022693</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Determination of complement factor H functional polymorphisms (V62I, Y402H, and E936D) using sequence-specific primer PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphisms.		BACKGROUND: Complement factor H (CFH; HF) is an essential regulatory protein that plays a critical role in the homeostasis of the complement system in plasma. Several polymorphisms and mutations in the complement factor H gene (CFH; HF1) have been identified. These have revealed interesting associations with hemolytic-uremic syndrome and age-related macular degeneration. METHODS AND RESULTS: The aim of this study was to develop a rapid and reliable assay for determining genotypic variants of the CFH gene. Sequence-specific primer PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism techniques were chosen for the analysis of CFH polymorphisms. The assays detected the following published single nucleotide polymorphisms of CFH in our Caucasian population (n = 271): rs800292, 257G--&gt;A (V62I); rs1061170, 1277T--&gt;C (Y402H); and rs1065489, 2881G--&gt;T (E936D). The allele frequencies (257G = 0.850, 1277T = 0.574, and 2881G = 0.839) that we obtained from a healthy Hungarian population were consistent with previously published results. CONCLUSION: These analytical methods are simple, reliable, and rapid to perform, and are amenable to automation. Therefore, they could facilitate large-scale genotypic analyses of the CFH gene in various diseases, such as hemolytic-uremic syndrome, age-related macular degeneration, and cardiovascular diseases.</text><annotation id="T6"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="69" length="5"></location><text>Y402H</text></annotation><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="80" length="5"></location><text>E936D</text></annotation><annotation id="T5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="959" length="4"></location><text>V62I</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="977" length="9"></location><text>1277T--&gt;C</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1011" length="9"></location><text>2881G--&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="949" length="8"></location><text>257G--&gt;A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1061170</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs800292</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#6"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1061170</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T6" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs800292</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T5" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1065489</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1065489</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16876983</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Confirmatory evidence for an association of the connexin-36 gene with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.		Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) is a genetically determined common subtype of idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Recently, linkage of JME to the chromosomal region 15q14, as well as an allelic and genotypic association between the synonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphism c.588C&gt;T (dbSNP: rs3743123, S196S) of the positional candidate gene connexin-36 (CX36) and JME have been reported. The present replication study examined this tentative association in 247 German JME patients and 621 population controls. The frequency of the c.588T allele was significantly increased in the JME patients (35%) compared to controls (29.7%; P=0.016, one-tailed). Consistent to the original report, we also observed a significant increase of T/T homozygotes (13.4%) in the JME patients compared to controls (8.7%; P=0.019, one-tailed; OR(T/T+)=1.62; 95%-CI: 1.02-2.57).

Src-homology-2 (SH2)-B, a Janus tyrosine kinase 2-interacting protein, has been identified recently as a key regulator of leptin and insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, and body weight in mice. The aim of this study was to determine whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human SH2B gene are associated with these variables. A tagging SNP (tSNP), Ala484Thr (rs7498665), was selected to represent five common SNPs (minor allele frequency &gt; 0.05) in perfect linkage disequilibrium in a 16-kb region encompassing the SH2B gene. The tSNP was genotyped in 2455 white female twins (mean age, 47.4 +/- 12.6 years) from the St. Thomas' United Kingdom Adult Twin Registry (Twins United Kingdom). Ala484Thr (minor allele frequency, 0.38) was associated with serum leptin, total fat, waist circumference, and body weight (P = 0.02 to 0.04). The coding SNP has no predicted effect on protein structure or function and is likely to be in linkage disequilibrium with an as-yet unidentified functional variant in the SH2B gene. Our results support a role for SH2-B in modulating the regulation of body weight and fat by leptin in this female population. If SH2-B signaling is attenuated in diet-induced obesity, it could become a target for drug-induced leptin sensitization.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="452" length="9"></location><text>Ala484Thr</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs7498665</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17119036</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic polymorphisms of the CYP19A1 gene and breast cancer survival.		The CYP19A1 protein (aromatase) plays a critical role in estrogen biosynthesis and thus may be related to the progression of breast cancer. We examined the association between CYP19A1 genetic polymorphisms and breast cancer survival in a cohort of 1,136 patients who were recruited as part of a population-based case-control study in Shanghai, China from 1996 to 1998 and who has donated a DNA sample to the study. Patients were followed for cancer recurrence and mortality through July 2005. Nineteen haplotype tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the CYP19A1 gene were evaluated. For each of the five SNPs located in haplotype block 2, patients homozygous for the minor alleles had a reduced 5-year disease-free survival rate compared with those carrying the major allele. The age-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were 1.5 (1.1-2.1), 2.1 (1.2-3.6), 1.5 (1.1-2.0), 1.4 (1.0-2.0), and 1.4 (1.0-2.0) for hCV1664178, rs12900137, rs730154, rs936306, and rs1902586, respectively. Haplotype analyses showed that the haplotype CCCTA (all minor alleles of the five SNPs in block 2) was associated with decreased disease-free survival (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.3). The nonsynonymous SNP, rs700519 (Arg264Cys), located in haplotype block 4, was also associated with breast cancer survival. The age-adjusted HR for the Cys/Cys (T/T) genotype was 2.2 (95% CI, 1.2-4.1) for overall survival and 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-3.9) for disease-free survival, compared with those carrying the Arg (C) allele. These results suggest that polymorphisms in the CYP19A1 gene may have effects on breast cancer prognosis.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1304" length="9"></location><text>Arg264Cys</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs700519</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17603290</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) polymorphisms and breast cancer risk in Korean women.		Cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) is involved in the 2-hydroxylation of estrogen, the hormone that plays a critical role in the etiology of breast carcinoma. We evaluated the associations between two CYP1A1 polymorphisms [MspI (rs4646903); Ile462Val (rs1048943)] and breast cancer in a multicenter case-control study of 513 breast cancer cases and 447 controls in Korea. Women carrying the T allele of the CYP1A1 MspI polymorphism were found to have a 1.72-fold (95% CI 1.11-2.68) greater risk of developing breast cancer. No association was found between any CYP1A1 Ile462Val polymorphism and breast cancer. Haplotype analysis of the two loci showed that the CA haplotype was associated with the lowest risk of breast cancer, and CA/CA diplotypes were associated with a lower risk of breast cancer [OR=0.28 (0.13-0.61)] than others/others diplotypes. Moreover, this reduced risk was more pronounced among women with a lower body mass index (BMI) [OR=0.18 (0.06-0.58)] or with a shorter lifetime exposure to estrogen [OR=0.23 (0.07-0.81)]. The results obtained suggest that the CYP1A1 MspI polymorphisms could affect susceptibility to breast cancer.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="319" length="9"></location><text>Ile462Val</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1048943</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17964050</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Lack of association between three serotonin genes and suicidal behavior in Chinese psychiatric patients.		BACKGROUND: Suicide is a significant health problem throughout the world. The serotoninergic system is believed to be involved in suicidal behavior and there is evidence of biological abnormalities of two serotonin receptors (HTR2A, HTR2C) and one serotonin transporter (5HTT) in suicide victims. Rs6313 (T102C) of HTR2A and rs6318 (Cys23Ser) of HTR2C have been investigated in suicide behavior in other studies. METHODS: Here, we investigated rs6313 and rs6318 and other 10 randomly chosen SNPs, of those three genes in a study of 329 psychiatric patients who had never attempted suicide and 297 patients who had attempted suicide. RESULTS: No associations were found for the 12 SNPS.

Fkbp6 has been proved to be a new component of synaptonemal complexes and be involved in homologous chromosomes pairing and male infertility in mice. To explore the possible association between variations in the FKBP6 gene and impaired spermatogenesis in human, mutation screening of all the eight exons and the intron/exon boundaries of the gene was performed in 323 patients with azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia and 205 fertile controls by denatured HPLC and DNA sequencing. As a result, four novel and one known single nucleotide transitions were identified, including c.58-2A&gt;G, c.111C&gt;T, c.156G&gt;T, c.594G&gt;A, and c.216C&gt;A (rs3750075). The frequencies of genotype CA, allele A of c.216C&gt;A and haplotype 'GAG' consisting of c.156G&gt;T, c.216C&gt;A, and c.594G&gt;A were significantly lower in infertile patients than those in controls. These findings suggest that the FKBP6 gene may play a role in modifying the susceptibility to idiopathic spermatogenic impairment in human and propose that the allele A of c.216C&gt;A seems to be a protective factor for the development of male infertility.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="812" length="8"></location><text>c.216C&gt;A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3750075</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17192491</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A functional polymorphism in the manganese superoxide dismutase gene and diabetic nephropathy.		Oxidative stress has been suggested to contribute to the development of diabetic nephropathy. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) protects the cells from oxidative damage by scavenging free radicals. The demand for antioxidants is increased by smoking, which could disturb the balance between antioxidants and radicals. The present study aimed to determine whether a valine/alanine polymorphism in MnSOD (V16A, rs4880), alone or in combination with smoking, can contribute to development of diabetic nephropathy in 1,510 Finnish and Swedish patients with type 1 diabetes. Overt diabetic nephropathy (n = 619) was defined as having an albumin excretion rate (AER) &gt;200 microg/min or renal replacement therapy; incipient diabetic nephropathy was defined as having an AER of 20-200 microg/min (n = 336). The control subjects had diabetes duration of &gt;or=20 years, without albuminuria (AER &lt;20 microg/min) and without antihypertensive treatment (n = 555). In addition to male sex and elevated A1C, smoking was significantly associated with diabetic nephropathy (overt plus incipient), odds ratio (OR) 2.00 (95% CI 1.60-2.50). When controlling for age at onset, diabetes duration, A1C, smoking, and sex, the Val/Val genotype was associated with an increase in risk of diabetic nephropathy (1.32 [1.00-1.74], P = 0.049). When evaluating the combined effect of genotype and smoking, we used logistic regression with stratification according to smoking status and genotype. The high-risk group (ever smoking plus Val/Val genotype) had 2.52 times increased risk of diabetic nephropathy (95% CI 1.73-3.69) compared with the low-risk group, but no departure from additivity was found. Our results indicate that smoking and homozygosity for the MnSOD Val allele is associated with an increased risk of diabetic nephropathy, which supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress contributes to the development of diabetic nephropathy.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="504" length="4"></location><text>V16A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4880</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17293864</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A common coding variant in CASP8 is associated with breast cancer risk.		The Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) has been established to conduct combined case-control analyses with augmented statistical power to try to confirm putative genetic associations with breast cancer.

Folate metabolism plays a critical role in embryonic development. Prenatal folate supplementation reduces the risk of neural tube defects and probably oral facial clefts. Previous studies of related metabolic genes have associated polymorphisms in cystathionine-beta-synthase (CBS) and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) with cleft risk. We explored associations between genes related to one-carbon metabolism and clefts in a Norwegian population-based study that included 362 families with cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P) and 191 families with cleft palate only (CPO). We previously showed a 39% reduction in risk of CL/P with folic acid supplementation in this population. In the present study we genotyped 12 polymorphisms in nine genes related to one-carbon metabolism and looked for associations of clefting risk with fetal polymorphisms, maternal polymorphisms, as well as parent-of-origin effects, using combined likelihood-ratio tests (LRT). We also stratified by maternal periconceptional intake of folic acid (&gt;400 microg) to explore gene-exposure interactions. We found a reduced risk of CL/P with mothers who carried the CBS C699T variant (rs234706); relative risk was 0.94 with one copy of the T allele (95% CI 0.63-1.4) and 0.50 (95% CI 0.26-0.96) with two copies (P = 0.008). We found no evidence of interaction of this variant with folate status. We saw no evidence of risk from the MTHFR C677T variant (rs1801133) either overall or after stratifying by maternal folate intake. No associations were found between any of the polymorphisms and CPO. Genetic variations in the nine metabolic genes examined here do not confer a substantial degree of risk for clefts.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1266" length="5"></location><text>C699T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs234706</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16630992</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A common polymorphism in the complement factor H gene is associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction: the Rotterdam Study.		OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to investigate the association between a common polymorphism (Tyr402His, rs1061170) in the complement factor H (CFH) gene and risk of coronary heart disease. BACKGROUND: The evidence that inflammation is an important mechanism in atherogenesis is growing. C-reactive protein (CRP), complement factors, and complement regulatory factors have all been linked to coronary heart disease. The CFH gene is an important regulator of the alternative complement cascade. We investigated its association with coronary heart disease. METHODS: The study was embedded in the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based study among men and women aged 55 years and over. A total of 5,520 participants without history of coronary heart disease was genotyped for the Tyr402His polymorphism of the CFH gene. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to determine risk of myocardial infarction for Tyr402His genotypes. RESULTS: Mean age among participants was 69.5 years (SD 9.1 years). The overall frequency of the His allele was 36%; genotype frequencies were 41%, 45%, and 14% for TyrTyr, TyrHis, and HisHis, respectively. During a mean follow-up period of 8.4 years, 226 myocardial infarctions occurred. After adjustment for age, gender, established cardiovascular risk factors, and CRP level, HisHis homozygotes had a hazard ratio of 1.77 (95% confidence interval 1.23 to 2.55) for myocardial infarction. Total cholesterol level, diabetes mellitus, and smoking modified the effect. The Tyr402His polymorphism was not associated with established cardiovascular risk factors or CRP level. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the CFH gene determines susceptibility to myocardial infarction. This finding underscores the importance of the alternative complement system in cardiovascular disease.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="234" length="9"></location><text>Tyr402His</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1061170</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18057531</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Homogeneous assay of rs4343, an ACE I/D proxy, and an analysis in the British Women's Heart and Health Study (BWHHS).		Current literature suggests that ACE SNP rs4343, ACE 2350A&gt;G in exon 17, T202T, may be the best proxy for the ACE Alu I/D whereas rs4363 and rs4362 may be slightly stronger predictors of ACE levels. Considering reported difficulties in genotyping ACE I/D and stronger associations of rs4343 than ACE I/D with plasma ACE levels in Africans, and suitability of rs4343 for allelic mRNA (cDNA) studies, we developed and validated a liquid phase assay for rs4343, which has advantage on both functional and technical grounds. We confirmed that rs4343, is in near perfect linkage disequilibrium (D'=1, r2=0.88, n=64) with ACE I/D in Europeans (A and G alleles of rs4343 marking insertion and deletion alleles of ACE I/D respectively). We then studied its association with metabolic and cardiovascular traits in 3253 British women (60-79 years old). Apart from a nominal trend of association with diastolic blood pressure (p anova=0.08; p trend=0.05), no other associations were observed. A post-hoc vascular and general phenome scan revealed no further associations. We conclude that ACE I/D is not a major determinant of metabolic and cardiovascular traits in this population. Liquid phase genotyping of SNP rs4343 may be preferable to gel based ACE I/D genotyping both for technical and functional reasons.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="172" length="7"></location><text>2350A&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="192" length="5"></location><text>T202T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4343</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4343</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16525568</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Epistatic and pleiotropic effects of polymorphisms in the fibrinogen and coagulation factor XIII genes on plasma fibrinogen concentration, fibrin gel structure and risk of myocardial infarction.		An intricate interplay between the genes encoding fibrinogen gamma (FGG), alpha (FGA) and beta (FGB), coagulation factor XIII (F13A1) and interleukin 6 (IL6) and environmental factors is likely to influence plasma fibrinogen concentration, fibrin clot structure and risk of myocardial infarction (MI). In the present study, the potential contribution of SNPs harboured in the fibrinogen, IL6 and F13A1 genes to these biochemical and clinical phenotypes was examined. A database and biobank based on 387 survivors of a first MI and population-based controls were used. Sixty controls were selected according to FGG 9340T &gt; C [rs1049636] genotype for studies on fibrin clot structure using the liquid permeation method. The multifactor dimensionality reduction method was used for interaction analyses. We here report that the FGA 2224G &gt; A [rs2070011] SNP (9.2%), plasma fibrinogen concentration (13.1%) and age (8.1%) appeared as independent determinants of fibrin gel porosity. The FGA 2224G &gt; A SNP modulated the relation between plasma fibrinogen concentration and fibrin clot porosity. The FGG-FGA*4 haplotype, composed of the minor FGG 9340C and FGA 2224A alleles, had similar effects, supporting its reported protective role in relation to MI. Significant epistasis on plasma fibrinogen concentration was detected between the FGA 2224G &gt; A and F13A1 Val34Leu [rs5985] SNPs (p &lt; 0.001). The FGG 9340T &gt; C and FGB 1038G &gt; A [rs1800791] SNPs appeared to interact on MI risk, explaining the association of FGG-FGB haplotypes with MI in the absence of effects of individual SNPs. Thus, epistatic and pleiotropic effects of polymorphisms contribute to the variation in plasma fibrinogen concentration, fibrin clot structure and risk of MI.</text><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1552" length="8"></location><text>Val34Leu</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1614" length="10"></location><text>1038G &gt; A </text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="810" length="9"></location><text>9340T &gt; C</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1025" length="9"></location><text>2224G &gt; A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1800791</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2070011</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5985</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1049636</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18195729</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta gene is associated with antidepressant treatment response in Chinese major depressive disorder.		Evidence suggests that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3B) activity is increased significantly in the brain of patients with major depressive disorders (MDD). Inhibition of GSK3B is thought to be a key feature in the therapeutic mechanism of antidepressants. To investigate whether common genetic variants in the GSK3B gene are associated with MDD and the therapeutic response to antidepressants, four polymorphisms (rs334558 (-50 T&gt;C), rs13321783 (IVS7+9227 A&gt;G), rs2319398 (IVS7+11660 G&gt;T) and rs6808874 (IVS11+4251 T&gt;A)) of the GSK3B gene were genotyped in 230 Chinese MDD patients and 415 controls. Among the MDD patients, 168 accepted selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (fluoxetine or citalopram) antidepressant treatment and therapeutic evaluation for 4 weeks and 117 for 8 weeks. Significant association with MDD was not shown in the alleles and genotypes of single loci or four-locus haplotypes. However, three of the four polymorphisms investigated were significantly associated with 4-week antidepressant therapeutic effect (P=0.002-0.011). Of the four-locus haplotype analysis, the GSK3B TAGT carriers showed a poorer response to antidepressants in 4-week (P&lt;0.0001) and 8-week (P=0.015) evaluation compared with other haplotype groups and would quite likely be the non-remitter to 8-week antidepressant treatment (P=0.006). Our findings show, for the first time, that GSK3B genetic variants play a role in the SSRI antidepressant therapeutic response and support the hypothesis that drugs regulating GSK3B activity may represent a novel treatment strategy for MDD.</text><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="580" length="13"></location><text>IVS7+9227 A&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="558" length="7"></location><text>-50 T&gt;C</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="607" length="14"></location><text>IVS7+11660 G&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="638" length="14"></location><text>IVS11+4251 T&gt;A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs334558</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6808874</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs13321783</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2319398</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17671508</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A common variant of the interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6r) gene increases IL-6r and IL-6 levels, without other inflammatory effects.		Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key inflammatory cytokine, signalling to most tissues by binding to a soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6r), making a complex with gp130. We used 1273 subjects (mean age 68 years) from the InCHIANTI Italian cohort to study common variation in the IL-6r locus and associations with interleukin 6 receptor (IL-6r), IL-6, gp130 and a battery of inflammatory markers. The rs4537545 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) tags the functional non-synonymous Asp358Ala variant (rs8192284) in IL-6r (r(2)=0.89, n=343). Individuals homozygous for the rs4537545 SNP minor allele (frequency 40%) had a doubling of IL-6r levels (132.48 pg/ml, 95% CI 125.13-140.27) compared to the common allele homozygous group (68.31 pg/ml, 95% CI 65.35-71.41): in per allele regression models, the rs4537545 SNP accounted for 20% of the variance in sIL-6r, with P=5.1 x 10(-62). The minor allele of rs4537545 was also associated with higher circulating IL-6 levels (P=1.9 x 10(-4)). There was no association of this variant with serum levels of gp130 or with any of the studied pro- and anti-inflammatory markers. A common variant of the IL-6r gene results in major changes in IL-6r and IL-6 serum levels, but with no apparent effect on gp130 levels or on inflammatory status in the general population.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="599" length="9"></location><text>Asp358Ala</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2228145</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17569747</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>APRIL polymorphism and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) susceptibility.		OBJECTIVE: Two novel non-synonymous polymorphisms of the APRIL gene, codon 67 (rs11552708) and 96 (rs3803800), were recently identified and tested for disease association. The 67G allele was reported to be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a Japanese population. The aim of the study is to investigate whether the APRIL polymorphism associated with susceptibility to SLE in a Japanese population is associated with the susceptibility to SLE in other ethnic groups. METHODS: Three hundred and forty-eight SLE patients (204 European-American, 103 African-American and 41 Hispanic) and 345 ethnicity-matched controls (201 European-American, 104 African-American and 40 Hispanic) were included from the Lupus Multiplex Registry and Repository (LMRR) and evaluated for genetic association. The APRIL codon 67 and codon 96 were genotyped by a 3-base extension method. Statistical evaluations were performed using both chi-square and logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Both the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in cases and controls within each ethnic group. The APRIL codon 67 was significantly associated with SLE risk under the dominant model adjusted by ethnicity (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval and P-values were 1.45 and 1.02-2.06 and 0.036, respectively). Race-specific analysis also showed a trend for association in African-American and Hispanic SLE subjects. CONCLUSION The APRIL codon G67R polymorphism associated with SLE in a Japanese population may also be associated with SLE in other populations.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1534" length="4"></location><text>G67R</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11552708</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16865697</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Ethnic variation in AMD-associated complement factor H polymorphism p.Tyr402His.		Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of irreversible visual loss in the developed world. Previous studies have demonstrated that the c.1204T&gt;C, p.Tyr402His allelic variant in the complement factor H (CFH) gene is associated with an approximately three-fold increased risk for AMD in Caucasians of predominantly European descent. Both the prevalence as well as the phenotypic spectrum of AMD varies widely among persons of different ethnicities. We hypothesized that populations with a lower prevalence of AMD might also have a lower prevalence of the CFH risk allele. In this study we sought to determine the frequency of this sequence variant in control populations of Caucasians, African Americans, Hispanics, Somalis, and Japanese. Normal control populations were assembled for each ethnic group: Caucasian (n=148), Somali (n=128), African American (n=75), Hispanic (n=81), and Japanese (n=82). Individuals were genotyped using a restriction digest assay and the frequency of the C allele at nucleotide position 1204 of the CFH gene was determined. A bioinformatic approach was used to identify SNPs in linkage disequilibrium with rs1061170 (c.1204T&gt;C, p.Tyr402His) from the human haplotype map project database (HapMap) in order to validate the findings. We found widely discordant frequencies of the risk allele between some of the different ethnic groups: Japanese 0.07+/-0.02, Hispanics 0.17+/-0.03, African-Americans 0.35+/-0.04, Caucasians 0.34+/-0.03, and Somalis 0.34+/-0.03. Allele frequencies generated by analysis of the HapMap database were consistent with these findings. This study suggests that there are other yet unidentified genetic factors important in the pathogenesis of AMD that may mitigate the effects of c.1204T&gt;C, p.Tyr402His variant.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="242" length="9"></location><text>c.1204T&gt;C</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="68" length="11"></location><text>p.Tyr402His</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1061170</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1061170</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17690546</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in the lysyl oxidase-like 1 gene and spontaneous cervical artery dissection.		BACKGROUND: Spontaneous cervical artery dissection (sCAD) is a common cause of stroke in patients below 55 years. Dermal connective tissue abnormalities have been observed in up to 60% of patients. A chromosomal locus for connective tissue abnormalities associated with sCAD has been mapped to chromosome 15q24 to a candidate region containing the lysyl oxidase-like 1 gene (LOXL1). LOXL1 an excellent candidate susceptibility gene for non-familial sCAD was investigated by mutation analysis and a genetic association study. METHODS: We sequenced the whole coding region of the LOXL1 gene in 15 sCAD patients and performed a genetic association study in 157 sCAD patients using 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). RESULTS: The SNP rs3825942 (Gly153Asp) showed marginal association with sCAD on an allele basis and in the dominant genetic model, and intronic SNP rs893817 under a recessive model only. None of the SNP haplotypes was associated with sCAD.

BACKGROUND: A novel member of the Wnt signalling pathway, Chibby, was recently identified. This protein inhibits Wnt/beta-catenin mediated transcriptional activation by competing with Lef-1 (the transcription factor and target of beta-catenin) to bind to beta-catenin. This suggests that Chibby could be a tumour suppressor protein. The C22orf2 gene coding Chibby is located on chromosome 22, a region recurrently lost in colorectal cancer. Activation of the Wnt pathway is a major feature of colorectal cancer and occurs through inactivation of APC or activation of beta-catenin. All of this led us to analyse the possible implication of Chibby in colorectal carcinogenesis. METHODS: First, 36 tumour and matched normal colonic mucosa DNA were genotyped with five microsatellite markers located on chromosome 22 to search for loss of heterozygosity. Then, mutation screening of the C22orf2 coding sequence and splice sites was performed in the 36 tumour DNA. Finally, expression of Chibby was analysed by quantitative RT-PCR on 10 patients, 4 with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 22. RESULTS: Loss of heterozygosity involving the C22orf2 region was detected in 11 out of 36 patients (30%). Sequencing analysis revealed a known variant, rs3747174, in exon 5: T321C leading to a silent amino acid polymorphism A107A. Allelic frequencies were 0.69 and 0.31 for T and C variants respectively. No other mutation was detected. Among the 10 patients studied, expression analysis revealed that Chibby is overexpressed in 2 tumours and underexpressed in 1. No correlations were found with 22q LOH status. CONCLUSION: As no somatic mutation was detected in C22orf2 in 36 colorectal tumour DNA, our results do not support the implication of Chibby as a tumour suppressor in colorectal carcinogenesis. This was supported by the absence of underexpression of Chibby among the tumour samples with 22q LOH. The implication of other Wnt pathway members remains to be identified to explain the part of colorectal tumours without mutation in APC and beta-catenin.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1406" length="5"></location><text>A107A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1356" length="5"></location><text>T321C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3747174</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3747174</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17411440</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Ovarian cancer risk and common variation in the sex hormone-binding globulin gene: a population-based case-control study.		BACKGROUND: The sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a carrier protein that modulates the bio-availability of serum sex steroid hormones, which may be involved in ovarian cancer. We evaluated whether common genetic variation in SHBG and its 3' neighbor ATP1B2, in linkage disequilibrium, is associated with the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. METHODS: The study population included 264 women with ovarian carcinoma and 625 controls participating in a population-based case-control study in Poland. Five common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SHGB and five in ATP1B2 were selected to capture most common variation in this region. RESULTS: None of the SNPs evaluated was significantly associated with ovarian cancer risk, including the putative functional SNPs SHBG D356N (rs6259) and -67G&gt;A 5'UTR (rs1799941). However, our data were consistent with a decreased ovarian cancer risk associated with the variant alleles for these two SNPs, which have been previously associated with increased circulating levels of SHBG.

PURPOSE: The interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6), the gene that causes van der Woude syndrome has been shown to be associated with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without palate in several populations. This study aimed to confirm the contribution of IRF6 to cleft lip with or without palate risk in additional Asian populations. METHODS: A set of 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms was tested for association with cleft lip with or without palate in 77 European American, 146 Taiwanese, 34 Singaporean, and 40 Korean case-parent trios using both the transmission disequilibrium test and conditional logistic regression models. RESULTS: Evidence of linkage and association was observed among all four populations; and two specific haplotypes [GC composed of rs2235373-rs2235371 (p.V274I) and AAG of rs599021-rs2235373-rs595918] showed the most significant over- and undertransmission among Taiwanese cases (P=9x10(-6) and P=5x10(-6), respectively). The AGC/CGC diplotype composed of rs599021-rs2235373-rs2013162 showed almost a 7-fold increase in risk among the Taiwanese sample (P&lt;10(-3)). These results confirmed the contribution of this gene to susceptibility of oral clefts across different populations; however, the specific single nucleotide polymorphisms showing statistical significance differed among ethnic groups. CONCLUSION: The high-risk genotypes and diplotypes identified here may provide a better understanding of the etiological role of this gene in oral clefts and potential options for genetic counseling.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="882" length="7"></location><text>p.V274I</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2235371</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16935688</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Beta2-adrenoceptor polymorphisms and asthma from childhood to middle age in the British 1958 birth cohort: a genetic association study.		BACKGROUND: Functionally relevant polymorphisms of the beta2-adrenoceptor gene (ADRB2) are common in white populations, but their contribution to the burden of airways disease in the population is uncertain. We aimed to relate the long-term prevalence of asthma or wheeze to functional coding region polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene. METHODS: The British 1958 birth cohort consisted of all people born in Britain during a week in 1958. Asthma, wheezy bronchitis, and wheezing were ascertained by interview at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, 33, and 42 years, and lung function tests at 35 and 45 years. DNA samples from 8018 participants in the 45-year follow-up were genotyped for three coding variants in the ADRB2 gene. We extend the follow-up of this nationwide cohort by a further 10 years and relate asthma prevalence, prognosis, and lung function to functional coding region polymorphisms in the ADRB2 gene in the cohort members who contributed DNA samples. We also compared and combined our findings with those reaching significance in two previous meta-analyses. FINDINGS: Half the cohort (4105 of 8018) had some history of wheezing illness by age 42 years. Neither lifetime prevalence nor age at onset were related to ADRB2 coding variants. However, the common polymorphisms Arg16Gly (rs1042713, Arg 16 allele frequency 36.3%) and Gln27Glu (rs1042714, Glu 27 allele frequency 44.6%) were significantly associated with persistence of asthmatic symptoms from childhood to middle age. Among homozygotes for the Arg16-Gln27 haplotype at these loci, 19.3% (41 of 212) childhood wheezers had five or more wheezing episodes in the past year at age 42, compared with 11.9% (71 of 599) with no copy of this haplotype. However, only 3% of all frequent adult wheezing was statistically attributable to this haplotype. The less common Thr164Ile polymorphism (rs1800888, Ile allele frequency 1.5%) was not a major predictor of either frequency or prognosis of asthma. Our data do not support the findings of previous meta-analyses when considered in isolation or when combined with their contributory studies. INTERPRETATION: ADRB2 polymorphisms might predict a small component of the long-term prognosis in childhood asthma, but are not important determinants of asthma incidence or prevalence in the British population.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1409" length="8"></location><text>Arg16Gly</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1957" length="9"></location><text>Thr164Ile</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1465" length="8"></location><text>Gln27Glu</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1042713</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1042714</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1800888</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17684144</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Analysis of genes critical for growth regulation identifies Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 Receptor variations with possible functional significance as risk factors for osteosarcoma.		BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma, the most common malignant primary bone tumor, typically occurs during the adolescent growth spurt. Germ-line genetic variation in genes critical in growth regulation could confer altered risk of osteosarcoma. METHODS: Fifty-two common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 13 genes were genotyped in a prospective case-control study of osteosarcoma (104 osteosarcoma cases and 74 orthopedic controls). Genotype data analyzed with contingency tables suggested the strongest association with insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) SNPs. Additional SNPs were genotyped to capture IGF2R common haplotypes and resequencing was done across the IGF2R block associated with osteosarcoma risk. Percentage methylation was determined by pyrosequencing of the IGF2R variant allele located in a CpG island. RESULTS: IGF2R Ex16+88G&gt;A (rs998075) and IVS16+15C&gt;T (rs998074) SNPs were associated with increased risk for osteosarcoma compared with orthopedic controls (haplotype odds ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-3.24). Follow-up genotyping showed that IGF2R IVS15+213C&gt;T was also associated with increased osteosarcoma risk. Resequence analysis identified two additional SNPs linked to the risk-associated SNPs; linkage disequilibrium was strongest in a 1-kb pair region around them. The Ex16+88G&gt;A SNP is located within a CpG island and alters methylation at that site. CONCLUSION: This pilot study of germ-line genetic variation in growth pathway genes and osteosarcoma identified a haplotype block in IGF2R associated with increased risk of osteosarcoma. The presence of a SNP in this block results in loss of methylation at a CpG island, providing corroborative evidence of a possible functional variant. Our analysis of the IGF2R haplotype structure will be applicable to future studies of IGF2R and disease risk.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1053" length="11"></location><text>IVS16+15C&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs998074</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>14755442</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>TNXB locus may be a candidate gene predisposing to schizophrenia.		We report here on the detection of nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near to the NOTCH4 locus in the search for schizophrenia susceptibility genes in the class III region of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We totally analyzed 122 family trios recruited in the UK. The TDT analysis demonstrated that of the nine SNPs, three were associated with schizophrenia, including rs1009382 (P = 0.00047), rs204887 (P = 0.007), and rs8283 (P = 0.015). Both rs1009382 and rs204887 are present in the TNXB locus. The rs1009382 is a non-synonymous SNP located in exon 23 of the gene and its A to G base change causes a Glu2578Gly substitution. The goodness-of-fit test showed that genotypic distribution of rs1009382 was deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium due to homozygote excess in the patient group (P = 0.01), suggesting that a double dose of a genetic risk may be involved. Possibly, rs1009382 is a candidate SNP predisposing to a schizophrenic illness. Moreover, the test for linkage disequilibrium (LD) between paired SNPs showed that the nine SNPs studied may be in the same LD block with an unexpected pattern as the strength of LD was not correlated with the distance between paired SNPs. The haplotype analysis suggested that there might be more than one disease-related allele located in the class III region of the MHC, and that these alleles possibly confer either susceptibility or resistance to schizophrenia.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="699" length="10"></location><text>Glu2578Gly</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1009382</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17498780</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>The influence of metabolic gene polymorphisms on urinary 1-hydroxypyrene concentrations in Chinese coke oven workers.		Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), a biomarker of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) exposure, may be influenced by metabolic gene polymorphisms. Such knowledge could benefit us in understanding the inter-individual difference in the mechanism of PAHs-induced carcinogenesis. We investigated the influence of gene polymorphisms on urinary 1-OHP concentrations in 447 coke oven workers from two coking plants in south China. After adjustment for age, plant, level of occupational exposure, body mass index, level of education, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking and respirator usage, AhR R554K (rs2066853), UGT1A1 -3263T&gt;G (rs4124874) and GSTP1 I105V (rs1695) were associated with urinary 1-OHP excretion with the p-value of 0.053, 0.006 and 0.021, respectively. The concentrations of urinary 1-OHP (Geometric mean, micromol/mol creatinine) in the homozygous major variant carriers and homozygous minor variant carriers for AhR R554K, UGT1A1 -3263T&gt;G and GSTP1 I105V were listed as follows: 4.20 and 5.12, 5.11 and 3.92, 4.93 and 2.91, respectively. GSTT1 present carriers had a significantly higher urinary 1-OHP level than that in null carriers in the case with AhR R554K GA/AA carriers (5.17 vs. 3.64 micromol/mol creatinine, p=0.038), as well as in the case with UGT1A1 -3263T&gt;G TG/GG carriers (5.67 vs. 3.38 micromol/mol creatinine, p=0.001). These results showed that AhR, UGT1A1, GSTP1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms were associated with urinary 1-OHP concentrations in Chinese coke oven workers. No influence was found in the association between urinary 1-OHP and other genetic polymorphisms such as CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2E1, EPHX1, EPHX2 in this population.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="739" length="8"></location><text>-3263T&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="713" length="5"></location><text>R554K</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="770" length="5"></location><text>I105V</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4124874</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1695</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2066853</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17944986</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Clinical and genetic correlates of soluble P-selectin in the community.		BACKGROUND: P-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule that is involved in atherogenesis, and soluble concentrations of this biomarker reflect cardiovascular risk. However, the clinical correlates and genetic characterization of soluble P-selectin have not been clearly elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical and genetic correlates of circulating P-selectin in the community. METHODS: In Framingham Heart Study Offspring (European descent) and Omni (ethnic/racial minority) participants, we examined the association of cardiovascular risk factors with soluble P-selectin concentrations. In Offspring participants, we evaluated heritability, linkage and association of 29 SELP single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with adjusted P-selectin concentrations. RESULTS: In multivariable analysis of 3,690 participants (54% women, mean age 60 +/- 10 years), higher log-transformed P-selectin concentrations were inversely associated with female sex and hormone replacement therapy, and positively associated with age, ethnic/racial minority status, cigarette smoking, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, fasting glucose, and total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. Clinical factors explained 10.4% of the interindividual variability in P-selectin concentrations. In 571 extended pedigrees (n = 1,841) with &gt;or= 2 phenotyped members per family, multivariable-adjusted heritability was 45.4 +/- 5.8%. Among the SELP SNPs examined, a non-synonymous SNP (rs6136) encoding a threonine-to-proline substitution at position 715 was highly significantly associated with decreased P-selectin concentrations (P = 5.2 x 10(-39)), explaining 9.7% of variation after adjustment for clinical factors. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple clinical factors and an SNP in the SELP gene were significantly associated with circulating P-selectin concentrations. One SNP in SELP explained significant variation in circulating P-selectin concentrations, even after accounting for known clinical correlates.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1584" length="49"></location><text>threonine-to-proline substitution at position 715</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6136</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17094261</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Effect of the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma 3 gene on BMI in 1,210 school students from Morelos, Mexico.		Little research has been undertaken on risk factors for obesity in young people in Latin America, including Mexico, despite the fact that obesity constitutes the number one public health problem in Mexico. Our objective was to investigate the effect of the Peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPAR)_3 gene on BMI measured among adolescents collected from a cohort study originally designed for epidemiological studies. METHODS: Blood samples and anthropometric measurements were collected from 1,210 out of 13,294 public school students of both sexes, aged 11-24 years in Morelos, Mexico. In this study, we genotyped 7 selected SNPs of the PPAR_ transcript variant 3 (including Pro12Ala) in a group of unrelated 717 males and 493 females (age range 11-24), including 3 SNPs located in the 5' untranslated region. These 7 SNPs were selected by the tagging algorithm implemented in the program haploview to scan the whole gene. We tested each of the 7 SNPs individually for association with the body mass index (BMI), and two SNPs (rs2938392 and rs1175542) revealed significant associations with BMI (p-value=0.008 and 0.029, respectively). The SNP rs2938392 is roughly 41.5 Kb from rs1801282 (Pro12Ala in PPAR_2). Furthermore, we examined the association between haplotypes built from 7 SNPs and BMI using a score statistic implemented in the program haplo.stats. While the permutation based global p-value was 0.544, one individual haplotype with a frequency of 0.279 gave a p-value of 0.089 (permutation based). However, when the analyses were conducted in males only, the permutation based global p-value was 0.055 and one individual haplotype with a frequency of 0.28 gave a significant p-value of 0.013.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1334" length="8"></location><text>Pro12Ala</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1801282</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18163425</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>The Glu228Ala polymorphism in the ligand binding domain of death receptor 4 is associated with increased risk for prostate cancer metastases.		BACKGROUND: Death receptor 4, encoded by the TNFRSF10A gene, is an important mediator of apoptosis and its dysfunction may be related to cancer development and distant tumor spread. A single nucleotide polymorphism in TNFRSF10A (Glu228Ala, rs20576) within a conserved region of the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of death receptor 4 has been associated with an increased risk for a variety of tumor entities. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of the TNFRSF10A polymorphism in metastatic progression of prostate cancer after radiation therapy. METHODS: We carried out a prospective study including 702 prostate cancer patients from the Austrian PROCAGENE (Prostate Cancer Genetics) study. Development of metastases was examined in regular follow-up investigations. TNFRSF10A genotypes were determined by a 5'-nuclease assay (TaqMan). RESULTS: Within a median follow-up time of 10 months (range 0-60 months), 24 (3.4%) patients developed metastases. In a Cox regression model including age at diagnosis and risk group as potential confounders, carriage of an 228Ala allele was associated with a relative risk of 2.47 (95% CI 1.10-5.54; P=0.028) for metastases. TNFRSF10A genotypes were not associated with tumor stage, grade, risk group or age at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the TNFRSF10A Glu228Ala polymorphism may be a novel independent risk factor for prostate cancer metastases after radiation therapy.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="4" length="9"></location><text>Glu228Ala</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs20576</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17535992</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Molecular evidence for a link between the N363S glucocorticoid receptor polymorphism and altered gene expression.		CONTEXT: A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human glucocorticoid receptor (hGR) N363S (rs6195) has been the focus of several clinical studies, and some epidemiological data link this SNP to increased glucocorticoid sensitivity, coronary artery disease, and increased body mass index. However, molecular studies in vitro using reporter gene expression systems have failed, for the most part, to define a link between this polymorphism and altered glucocorticoid receptor function. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to address the biological relevancy of N363S SNP in GR function by establishing stable U-2 OS (human osteosarcoma) cell lines expressing wild-type hGR or N363S and examining these receptors under a variety of conditions that probe for GR activity including human gene microarray analysis. DESIGN: Functional assays with reporter gene systems, Western blotting, and human microarray analysis were used to evaluate the activity of wild-type and N363S GR in both transiently and stably expressing cells. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm the microarray analysis. RESULTS: Functional assays with reporter gene systems and homologous down-regulation revealed only minor differences between the wild-type hGR and N363S receptors in both transiently and stably expressing cell lines. However, examination of the two receptors by human gene microarray analysis revealed a unique gene expression profile for N363S. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that the N363S SNP regulates a novel set of genes with several of the regulated genes supporting a potential role for this GR polymorphism in human diseases.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="42" length="5"></location><text>N363S</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6195</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17301261</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Dietary folate intake, MTHFR genetic polymorphisms, and the risk of endometrial cancer among Chinese women.		Folate plays an important role in carcinogenesis. The enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), encoded by the MTHFR gene, is involved in this process. We investigated both the independent and joint effects of dietary folate and other methyl-related nutrients, as well as three polymorphisms of MTHFR (677C&gt;T, 1298A&gt;C, and 1793G&gt;A), on endometrial cancer risk in a population-based case-control study. Between 1997 and 2003, 1,204 newly diagnosed endometrial cancer cases and 1,212 controls were recruited among women between the ages of 30 and 69 years in urban Shanghai, China. Information on dietary intake of folate and other methyl-related nutrients, including vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and methionine, was derived from a validated food frequency questionnaire. Genotyping was completed on 1,041 cases and 1,030 controls for MTHFR 677C&gt;T (rs1801133), 1298A&gt;C (rs1801131), and 1793 G&gt;A (rs2274967) [corrected] Haplotype estimation of the three single-nucleotide polymorphisms was performed using PHASE software. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to evaluate associations of nutrients, MTHFR genotypes, and haplotypes with endometrial cancer risk. A significant inverse association between dietary folate intake and endometrial cancer risk was observed among all subjects and non-B vitamin supplement users. The greatest reduction in endometrial cancer risk was observed among non-users of supplements in the highest quartile of dietary folate intake (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.4-0.7) as compared with those in the lowest quartile. Dietary intake of folate cofactors (methionine, vitamin B2, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12) was not related to risk of endometrial cancer. No association was observed between endometrial cancer and the MTHFR 677C&gt;T, 1298 A&gt;C, and 1793G&gt;A polymorphisms or derived haplotypes. Among non-users of supplements, however, the 1298C and 1793A alleles were associated with a lower risk of endometrial cancer among women with high dietary folate intake but related to a higher risk among those with low dietary folate intake (P(interaction) = 0.08 and 0.03, respectively). Further analysis showed that the lowest risk (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-1.1) was among women with the 1298C allele and the highest intake of both folate and riboflavin (P(interaction) = 0.04). A similar association was observed for the 1793A allele (P(interaction) = 0.03). Our findings suggest that folate intake may decrease the risk of endometrial cancer and modify the effect of MTHFR polymorphisms on risk.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1004" length="7"></location><text>1298A&gt;C</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="426" length="6"></location><text>677C&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="447" length="7"></location><text>1793G&gt;A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1801131</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2274967</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1801133</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17241179</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>The association between fibrinogen haplotypes and myocardial infarction in men is partly mediated through pleiotropic effects on the serum IL-6 concentration.		BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Fibrinogen haplotypes have been associated with risk of myocardial infarction (MI), independently of plasma fibrinogen concentration, and experimental data indicate that fibrinogen exerts pleiotropic effects on interleukin 6 (IL-6) production. Also, the coagulation factor XIII (gene symbol F13A1) Val34Leu haplotype tag single nucleotide polymorphism (htSNP) has been reported to exert pleiotropic effects on serum IL-6 concentration and to be associated with risk of MI. Therefore, in the present case-control study (a substudy to the Stockholm Heart Epidemiology Program), the effects of the fibrinogen gamma (FGG) 9340T&gt;C [rs1049636], fibrinogen alpha (FGA) 2224G&gt;A [rs2070011] and F13A1 Val34Leu [rs5985] htSNPs on concentrations of plasma fibrinogen and serum IL-6 and risk of MI were assessed. RESULTS: There were no associations between these SNPs and the plasma fibrinogen concentration. In contrast, in male controls the FGA 2224G&gt;A htSNP was significantly associated with serum IL-6 concentration (P &lt; 0.05). Also, in men the FGG-FGA*1 haplotype (containing the major FGG 9340T and FGA 2224G alleles) was associated with increased risk of MI [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.29 (1.02, 1.62)] and with higher IL-6 concentrations, whereas the least common FGG-FGA*4 haplotype (containing the minor FGG 9340C and FGA 2224A alleles) conferred lowered risk [adjusted OR (95% CI): 0.70 (0.57, 0.86)] and lowered IL-6 concentrations. In women, fibrinogen haplotypes were not associated with risk of MI after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSION: In healthy men, fibrinogen haplotypes are associated with serum IL-6 concentrations in a manner consistent with their impact on MI risk.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="849" length="7"></location><text>2224G&gt;A</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="485" length="8"></location><text>Val34Leu</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="805" length="7"></location><text>9340T&gt;C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2070011</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1049636</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5985</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15098000</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>COMT haplotypes suggest P2 promoter region relevance for schizophrenia.		A recent study found, in a large sample of Ashkenazi Jews, a highly significant association between schizophrenia and a particular haplotype of three polymorphic sites in the catechol-O-methyl transferase, COMT, gene: an IVS 1 SNP (dbSNP rs737865), the exon 4 functional SNP (Val158Met, dbSNP rs165688), and a downstream SNP (dbSNP rs165599). Subsequently, this haplotype was shown to be associated with lower levels of COMT cDNA derived from normal cortical brain tissue, most likely due to cis-acting element(s). As a first step toward evaluating whether this haplotype may be relevant to schizophrenia in populations other than Ashkenazi Jews, we have studied this haplotype in 38 populations representing all major regions of the world. Adding to our previous data on four polymorphic sites in the COMT gene, including the Val158Met polymorphism, we have typed the IVS 1 rs737865 and 3' rs615599 sites and also included a novel IVS 1 indel polymorphism, yielding seven-site haplotype frequencies for normal individuals in the 38 globally distributed populations, including a sample of Ashkenazi Jews. We report that the schizophrenia-associated haplotype is significantly heterogeneous in populations worldwide. The three-site, schizophrenia-associated haplotype frequencies range from 0% in South America to 37.1% in Southwest Asia, despite the fact that schizophrenia occurs at roughly equal frequency around the world. Assuming that the published associations found between the exon 4 Val158Met SNP and schizophrenia are due to linkage disequilibrium, these new haplotype data support the hypothesis of a relevant cis variant linked to the rs737865 site, possibly just upstream in the P2 promoter driving transcription of the predominant form of COMT in the brain. The previously described HindIII restriction site polymorphism, located within the P2 promoter, varies within all populations and may provide essential information in future studies of schizophrenia.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="349" length="9"></location><text>Val158Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4680</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17211857</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Quantitated transcript haplotypes (QTH) of AGTR1, reduced abundance of mRNA haplotypes containing 1166C (rs5186:A&gt;C), and relevance to metabolic syndrome traits.		The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1) is the main target through which angiotensin II influences cardiovascular tone, cell growth, and fluid and electrolyte balance. AGTR1 polymorphism has been reported to associate with hypertension, myocardial infarction (MI), and metabolic traits. Here we describe a novel approach to quantitation of transcript haplotypes (QTH) of AGTR1. To determine relative allelic expression from haplotypes, within-individual-between-allele ratiometric analyses in placental cDNA were developed for the transcribed SNPs rs5182:C&gt;T (encoding p.L191) and rs5186:A&gt;C (3'-noncoding "A1166C"). Additionally, between-individual comparisons were made using TaqMan assays applied to both homozygous and heterozygous genotypes and haplotypes. In conjunction, linkage disequilibrium (LD) and genomic haplotype associations with metabolic syndrome were examined. There was no significant difference of mRNA level for alleles of rs5182:C&gt;T, but allele and mRNA haplotypes carrying 1166C exhibited reduced abundance. The effect was much greater in CC homozygotes than in heterozygotes. The promoter region was confirmed to be in a separate haplotype block from the AGTR1 3' region containing rs5182:C&gt;T and rs5186:A&gt;C. Metabolic syndrome trait associations were strongest for the 3' block generally and for the C allele of rs5186:A&gt;C specifically. All effects were much more prominent in homozygotes, possibly reflecting interallelic interaction through feedback loops of mRNA regulation. Differential abundance of AGTR1 mRNA haplotypes may mediate clinical phenotypic observations of the AGTR1 genotype.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="773" length="6"></location><text>A1166C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5186</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18199129</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>The association of genetic variants in Kr端ppel-like factor 11 and Type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population.		AIMS: Kr端ppel-like factor 11 (KLF11) is a transcriptional factor of the zinc finger domain family that regulates the expression of insulin. In North European populations, its common functional variant Q62R (rs35927125) is a strong genetic factor for Type 2 diabetes (P = 0.00033, odds ratio for G allele = 1.29, 95% CI 1.12-1.49). We examined the contribution of KLF11 variants to the susceptibility to Type 2 diabetes in a Japanese population. METHODS: By re-sequencing Japanese individuals (n = 24, partly 96), we screened all four exons, exon/intron boundaries and flanking regions of KLF11. Verified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 731 initial samples (369 control and 362 case subjects). Subsequently, we tested for association in 1087 samples (524 control and 563 case subjects), which were collected in different districts of Japan from the initial samples. RESULTS: We identified eight variants, including a novel A/C variant on intron 3, but no mis-sense mutations. In an association study, we failed to find any significant result of SNPs (minor allele frequency 8.2-46.2%) after correcting for multiple testing. Similarly, no haplotypes were associated with Type 2 diabetes. It is notable that the G allele in rs35927125 was completely absent in 1818 Japanese individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants in KLF11 are unlikely to have a major effect of Type 2 diabetes in the Japanese population, although they were significantly associated in North European populations. These observations might help to determine the role of KLF11 variants in Type 2 diabetes in different populations.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="312" length="4"></location><text>Q62R</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs35927125</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18091023</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>SNPs in PPARG associate with type 2 diabetes and interact with physical activity.		PURPOSE: To study the associations of seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) gene with the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to type 2 diabetes (T2D), and the interactions of the SNPs with physical activity (PA). METHODS: Overweight individuals with IGT who participated in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study (DPS) (N = 479) were followed, on average, 4.2 yr. PA was assessed yearly with a 12-month validated questionnaire. RESULTS: In Cox regression analyses, the rare alleles of rs17036314 and rs1801282 (Pro12Ala) predicted conversion to T2D (P = 0.038 and 0.037, respectively), but only rs17036314 predicted T2D after adjustment for baseline fasting glucose (P = 0.030). The change in the total amount of PA, stratified by median, modified the association of rs17036314 and rs1801282 with the risk of T2D during the intervention (P = 0.002 and 0.031, respectively, for interaction between PA change and genotype); an increase in PA seemed to remove the effect of the risk alleles. The distinct rs1152003 polymorphism interacted with the study group on the conversion to T2D (P = 0.027) and tended to increase the risk of T2D in the intervention group (P = 0.050). No interaction between rs1152003 and the change in PA was found. CONCLUSIONS: The rs17036314, rs1801282 (Pro12Ala), and rs1152003 were associated with the risk of T2D in the DPS. Increased PA seemed to decrease the effect of the risk alleles of rs17036314 and rs1801282 on the conversion to T2D. The effect of rs1152003 was modified by other lifestyle changes or the lifestyle intervention as a whole.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="678" length="8"></location><text>Pro12Ala</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1801282</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16625213</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>ICAM1 amino-acid variant K469E is associated with paediatric bronchial asthma and elevated sICAM1 levels.		Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) acts as ligand for beta2-integrin molecules and mediates leucocyte trafficking to the site of inflammation. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1-deficient mice show impaired lymphocyte recruitment to the lung, less airway hyper-responsiveness and less lung inflammation than healthy controls. Thus, the aim of the study was to test common ICAM1 polymorphisms for association with paediatric asthma. Furthermore, we were interested in whether soluble ICAM1 (sICAM1) serum levels were in correlation with genotypes. The following polymorphisms in ICAM1 were genotyped on 352 children with asthma and 270 controls: rs5491 (resulting in the amino-acid exchange K56M), rs5493 (G241S), rs5498 (K469E), rs5030400 (R478W) and rs885743 in the 3'-untranslated region. In addition, sICAM1 serum levels were measured. Only K469E and rs885743 were present in our populations. K469E showed association with asthma (P = 0.0037 with Armitage's trend test). Haplotype analysis by FAMHAP using both polymorphisms revealed association with asthma by P &lt; 0.000001. In addition, serum sICAM1 levels were correlated with K469E genotypes (P = 0.009 by Kruskal-Wallis test). We conclude from our data that K469KE is associated with paediatric asthma in the German population. Furthermore, the same polymorphism is correlated with serum levels of sICAM1. Functional analyses have to further clarify the pathophysiological mechanism conferred by the polymorphisms.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="818" length="5"></location><text>G241S</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="853" length="5"></location><text>R478W</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="25" length="5"></location><text>K469E</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5493</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5498</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5030400</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17854076</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A variant of the Cockayne syndrome B gene ERCC6 confers risk of lung cancer.		Cockayne syndrome B protein (ERCC6) plays an essential role in DNA repair. However, the Cockayne syndrome caused by the ERCC6 defect has not been linked to cancer predisposition; likely due to the fact that cells with severe disruption of the ERCC6 function are sensitive to lesion-induced apoptosis, thus reducing the chance of tumorigenesis. The biological function and cancer susceptibility of a common variant rs3793784:C&gt;G (c.-6530C&gt;G) in the ERCC6 was examined. We show that the c.-6530C allele has lower binding affinity of Sp1 by EMSA and displays a lower transcriptional activity in vitro and in vivo. We then examined the contribution of this polymorphism to the risk of lung cancer in a case-control study with 1,000 cases and 1,000 controls. The case-control analysis revealed a 1.76-fold (P= x 10(-9)) excess risk of developing lung cancer for the c.-6530CC carriers compared with noncarriers. The c.-6530CC interacts with smoking to intensify lung cancer risk, with the odds ratio (OR)=9 for developing lung cancer among heavy smokers. Our data constituted strong evidence that ERCC6 rs3793784:C&gt;G alters its transcriptional activity and may confer personalized susceptibility to lung cancer.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="507" length="10"></location><text>c.-6530C&gt;G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3793784</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18470941</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Mutations in CYP1B1 cause primary congenital glaucoma by reduction of either activity or abundance of the enzyme.		Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused predominantly by mutations in the CYP1B1 gene. A total of five frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the coding sequence of CYP1B1: rs10012C&gt;G (p.R48G), rs1056827G&gt;T (p.A119S), rs1056836C&gt;G (p.V432L), rs1056837C&gt;T (p.D449D), and rs1800440A&gt;G (p.N453S). We performed a functional characterization of four common CYP1B1 variants presenting different coding SNP haplotypes (RAVDN, GSLDN, RALDS, and RALDN) and five CYP1B1 mutations reported for PCG patients: c.182G&gt;A (p.G61E), c.608A&gt;G (p.N203S), c.1033_1035del (p.L343del), c.241 T&gt;A (p.Y81N), and c.685G&gt;A (p.E229 K). Each mutation was embedded in its corresponding background SNP haplotype. The common variants revealed variation in enzymatic activity; among them, RAVDN showed the highest activity. Mutants p.G61E, p.N203S, and p.L343del each revealed a residual activity (&lt;10%) of their respective haplotype. The microsomal CYP1B1 abundance relative to total protein also showed variation in common variants and a significant reduction in p.L343del, p.Y81N, and p.E229 K. The free energy of folding (DeltaDeltaG) values suggest that the lower stability of the mutants is one key property leading to the experimentally observed lower protein abundance. Our new measure of relative enzymatic activity (U/mg total protein), which combines activity and abundance values, was significantly lower for all five mutations compared to the corresponding background haplotype. We classified p.Y81N and p.E229 K not as mutations but as hypomorphic alleles, since their relative activity values are intermediate between bona fide mutations and the common variant with the lowest activity (RALDS). We propose that CYP1B1 mutations can act by either reducing enzymatic activity (p.G61E and p.N203S), reducing the abundance of the enzyme (p.Y81N and p.E229 K), or both (p.L343del).</text></passage></document><document><id>17344938</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic polymorphisms of the urea transporter gene are associated with antihypertensive response to nifedipine GITS.		Nifedipine GITS has diuretic and natriuretic properties, which may enhance its antihypertensive efficacy. We assessed contributions of polymorphisms in the urea transporter-A gene (SLC14A2) to interindividual variations in blood pressure (BP) response to nifedipine treatment. 405 subjects from a single Chinese county received a single oral dose of 30 mg nifedipine GITS (gastrointestinal therapeutic system) daily for 16 days. We genotyped two SNPs in SLC14A2 and found significant associations for the Val227Ile (rs1123617) and Ala357Thr (rs3745009) polymorphisms with BP response to nifedipine treatment. After treatment, subjects with either Ala357/Thr357 or Thr357/Thr357 genotypes had significantly smaller mean changes in systolic BP (SBP) (beta +/- SE = -2.87 +/- 1.24 mmHg, p = 0.020) and diastolic BP (DBP) (beta +/- SE = -1.69 +/- 0.62 mmHg, p = 0.006) compared to those with the Ala357/Ala357 genotype. Subjects with either Val227/Ile227 or Ile227/Ile227 genotypes had significantly larger mean changes in SBP (beta +/- SE = 3.13 +/- 1.19, p = 0.009) and DBP (beta +/- SE = 1.50 +/- 0.60 mmHg, p = 0.013) compared with those with the Val227/Val227 genotype after treatment. Subjects carrying both the Ala357/Ala357 genotype in the Ala357Thr polymorphism and either Val227/Ile227 or Ile227/Ile227 genotypes in the Val227Ile polymorphism had the highest mean change in SBP and DBP. Our study supports the conclusion that polymorphisms in the SLC14A2 gene can predict the antihypertensive efficacy of nifedipine GITS.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="649" length="9"></location><text>Ala357Thr</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="623" length="9"></location><text>Val227Ile</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3745009</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1123617</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16330681</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>NAD(P)H oxidase and multidrug resistance protein genetic polymorphisms are associated with doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.		BACKGROUND: A significant number of patients treated with anthracyclines develop cardiotoxicity (anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity [ACT]), mainly presenting as arrhythmias (acute ACT) or congestive heart failure (chronic ACT). There are no data on pharmacogenomic predictors of ACT. METHODS AND RESULTS: We genotyped participants of the German non-Hodgkin lymphoma study (NHL-B) who were followed up for the development of heart failure for a median of &gt;3 years. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from 82 genes with conceivable relevance to ACT. Of 1697 patients, 55 developed acute and 54 developed chronic ACT (cumulative incidence of either form, 3.2%). We detected 5 significant associations with polymorphisms of the NAD(P)H oxidase and doxorubicin efflux transporters. Chronic ACT was associated with a variant of the NAD(P)H oxidase subunit NCF4 (rs1883112, -212A--&gt;G; symbols with right-pointing arrows, as edited?' odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% CI, 1.3 to 5.0). Acute ACT was associated with the His72Tyr polymorphism in the p22phox subunit (rs4673; OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.9) and with the variant 7508T--&gt;A (rs13058338; OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3 to 5.1) of the RAC2 subunit of the same enzyme. In agreement with these results, mice deficient in NAD(P)H oxidase activity, unlike wild-type mice, were resistant to chronic doxorubicin treatment. In addition, acute ACT was associated with the Gly671Val variant of the doxorubicin efflux transporter multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.6 to 8.4) and with the Val1188Glu-Cys1515Tyr (rs8187694-rs8187710) haplotype of the functionally similar MRP2 (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.0 to 5.4). Polymorphisms in adrenergic receptors previously demonstrated to be predictive of heart failure were not associated with ACT. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants in doxorubicin transport and free radical metabolism may modulate the individual risk to develop ACT.</text><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1151" length="8"></location><text>His72Tyr</text></annotation><annotation id="T5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1680" length="10"></location><text>Val1188Glu</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1015" length="9"></location><text>-212A--&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1691" length="10"></location><text>Cys1515Tyr</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1255" length="9"></location><text>7508T--&gt;A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1883112</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs13058338</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs17222723</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T5" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4673</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs8187710</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17429315</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic polymorphisms in estrogen-metabolizing genes and breast cancer survival.		BACKGROUND: Estrogen plays a central role in the development and progression of breast cancer. The estrogen's effects are at least partially regulated by estrogen-metabolizing enzymes. The objective of the study is to investigate associations of breast cancer survival with genetic polymorphisms in several genes involved in estrogen metabolism (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, COMT, and AhR). METHODS: A cohort of 1140 patients aged between 25 and 64 years at the time of diagnosis for primary breast cancer during 1996-1998 were included in the study. Patients were followed for cancer recurrence and mortality through July 2005. RESULTS: Associations were observed at rs4680 (Met158Val) in the COMT gene and rs4646903 (CYP1A1*2A) in the CYP1A1 gene. The adjusted hazard ratio for the rs4680 AA genotype (low enzyme activity genotype) was 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.4) compared with the GG genotype for disease-free survival. Adjusted hazard ratios for the rs4646903 CC genotype were 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.2) for disease-free survival and 1.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-2.1) for overall survival compared with the TT genotype. No apparent association was found for any of the other six single nucleotide polymorphisms evaluated in the AhR, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, and CYP1B1 genes. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that rs4680 in the COMT gene and rs4646903 in the CYP1A1 gene may be genetic markers for breast cancer prognosis in Chinese women.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="753" length="9"></location><text>Met158Val</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4680</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17656673</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 (SERPINE1) SNPs with myocardial infarction, plasma PAI-1, and metabolic parameters: the HIFMECH study.		OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene (SERPINE1) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), on PAI-1 levels, and factors related to the metabolic syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven SNPs capturing the common genetic variation of the SERPINE1 gene were genotyped in the HIFMECH study. In the 510 male cases and their 543 age-matched controls, a significant gene-smoking interaction was observed. In nonsmokers, the rs7242-G allele was more frequent in cases than in controls (0.486 versus 0.382, P=0.013) whereas the haplotype derived from the rs2227631 (-844A&gt;G)-G and rs2227683-A alleles was approximately 3-fold lower in cases than in controls (0.042 versus 0.115, P=0.006). SERPINE1 haplotypes explained 3.5% (P=0.007) of the variability of PAI-1 levels, which was attributable to the combined effects of 3 SNPs, -844A&gt;G, rs2227666, and rs2227694. The rs6092 (Ala15Thr) and rs7242 SNPs acted additively to explain 4.4% of the variability of plasma insulin levels and 1.6% of the variability of BMI (P&lt;10(-3) and P=0.023, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: SERPINE1 haplotypes are mildly associated with plasma levels of PAI-1 and with the risk of MI in nonsmokers. They are also associated with insulin levels and BMI.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="834" length="7"></location><text>-844A&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1143" length="8"></location><text>Ala15Thr</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2227631</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6092</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17034009</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Mutation screen of the GAD2 gene and association study of alcoholism in three populations.		Synaptic actions of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) have been implicated in many facets of ethanol's effects and risk for alcoholism. We examined whether variation in glutamate decarboxylase-2 (GAD2), a gene encoding for a major enzyme in the synthesis of GABA, contributes to risk of alcohol dependence (AD). We screened GAD2 for sequence variants using dHPLC in a population of 96 individuals. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including four rare non-synonymous polymorphisms, were identified. Thirteen SNPs located in the GAD2 gene were genotyped in a sample of 113 Russian males with AD and 100 Russian male controls. These analyses revealed a modest association between the functional GAD2 -243 A &gt; G SNP (rs2236418) and AD (allele P = 0.038, genotype P = 0.008). An additional sample of 138 Russian males with AD were genotyped for the GAD2 -243 A &gt; G. These analyses supported an association of this polymorphism with AD (combined sample allele P = 0.038, genotype P = 0.0009). We extended these findings to additional populations: a sample of 538 college students assessed using the AUDIT and a sample of European-American (EA) AD subjects (n = 235) and controls (n = 310). Analyses in these populations did not support a role for GAD2 in alcoholism. In summary, the results of an extensive search for an association of GAD2 with AD suggest that variation in GAD2 is not a major risk factor for AD in EAs. The functional promoter GAD2 -243 A &gt; G variant may influence risk for AD in some populations, or its role may be limited to susceptibility to severe AD.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="802" length="10"></location><text>-243 A &gt; G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2236418</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17210853</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Neovascular age-related macular degeneration and its association with LOC387715 and complement factor H polymorphism.		OBJECTIVE: To compare phenotypes of 2 age-related macular degeneration (AMD) susceptibility genes: LOC387715 and complement factor H (CFH). METHODS: Phenotypes of 755 AMD cases were characterized. The number of LOC387715 (T allele at rs10490924, or A69S) and CFH (T1277C at rs1061170, or Y402H) risk alleles were determined in each case. Individuals were divided into 5 groups by genotype: group 1, LOC-/- CFH-/-; group 2, LOC+/- CFH-/- or LOC+/+ CFH-/-; group 3, LOC-/- CFH+/- or LOC-/- CFH+/+; group 4, LOC+/- CFH+/-, LOC+/+ CFH+/-, or LOC+/- CFH+/+; and group 5, LOC+/+ CFH+/+. RESULTS: Signs of neovascular AMD including grade (P = .002), pigment epithelial detachment (P = .001), and subretinal hemorrhage (P&lt;.001) demonstrated significant association with groups 2, 4, and 5 vs groups 1 and 3. Group 5 had a significantly younger mean age (72.3 years) compared with other groups (P = .002).

OBJECTIVE: Proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a newly discovered serine protease that plays a key role in regulating plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Both rare mutations and common variants in the coding regions of PCSK9 affect LDL cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease risk, as well as response to lipid-lowering therapy. METHODS: The authors characterized the patterns of variation at the PCSK9 locus in African-Americans and European-Americans using resequenced data from the SeattleSNPs database (pga.gs.washington.edu). The authors performed a test of population differentiation and the long-range haplotype test to detect signatures of recent position selection on PCSK9. RESULTS: A significantly high FST (a measure of population differentiation) between African-Americans and European-Americans was noted for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs505151 (FST=0.309). The long-range haplotype test was suggestive of non-neutral evolution of two SNPs, rs505151 and rs562556 that are associated with elevated LDL cholesterol levels ('gain-of-function' mutations). The modes of selection were different between African-Americans and European-Americans. The authors observed signals of recent positive selection on the ancestral allele of nonsynonymous SNP rs505151 (E670G, P=0.0227 and P=0.0001 in theoretical and empirical distribution, respectively) and the derived allele of nonsynonymous SNP rs562556 (I474V, P=0.0227 and 0.0001) in African-Americans, whereas in European-Americans the ancestral allele of SNP rs562556 (P=0.1320 and 0.0370) appeared to be under positive selection. CONCLUSION: The authors' findings suggest that evolutionary dynamics may underlie the 'gain-of-function' mutations in PCSK9 that are associated with higher LDL cholesterol levels.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1413" length="5"></location><text>E670G</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1553" length="5"></location><text>I474V</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs505151</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs562556</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17701023</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Role of AMP-activated protein kinase gamma 3 genetic variability in glucose and lipid metabolism in non-diabetic whites.		AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a heterotrimeric enzyme that acts as an intracellular fuel sensor, directing multiple metabolic pathways in a catabolic direction in times of nutrient shortage. In humans, three different gamma-subunits (gamma(1), gamma(2), gamma(3)) have been identified as AMPK regulators. The AMPKgamma3 (protein kinase, AMP-activated, gamma 3 non-catalytic subunit, PRKAG3) isoform plays a role in gene regulation in glucose/lipid metabolism and skeletal muscle glycogen content. We investigated whether PRKAG3, in addition to being expressed in skeletal muscle, is also expressed in human liver. We also investigated whether genetic variance in PRKAG3 is associated with glucose and/or lipid metabolism in non-diabetic whites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After sequencing a screening cohort (n = 50) in the PRKAG3 locus, we genotyped 1061 participants for frequently found single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Association analyses between genotypes/haplotypes and metabolic traits were carried out. RESULTS: We detected PRKAG3 expression in human liver and skeletal muscle. Two SNPs (rs692243, rs6436094) with minor allele frequencies of 0.16 and 0.26 respectively and in moderate linkage disequilibrium (D' = 0.92; r (2) = 0.47) were found. rs692243 (C/G) confers a Pro71Ala mutation, while rs6436094 (A/G) is located in the 3' untranslated region. No associations with prediabetic traits such as body fat distribution, insulin resistance or insulin secretion were found (p &gt; 0.15 for all). However, the minor alleles of both SNPs were significantly associated with higher serum LDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein (Apo) B-100 levels (rs692243: CG:LDL 4.3%, ApoB-100 3.4%; GG:LDL 7.6%, ApoB-100 5.4%; p = 0.008 and p = 0.01 respectively; rs6436094: AG:LDL 3.3%, ApoB-100 1.7%; GG:LDL 11.3%, ApoB-100 11.1%; p = 0.009 and p = 0.05 respectively; dominant model). The GG/GG diplotype homozygous for both minor SNP alleles displayed the highest LDL-cholesterol among all frequent diplotypes (p = 0.059). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: While genetic variability in PRKAG3 does not seem to have a major effect on glucose metabolism, it may play an important role in lipoprotein metabolism in humans.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1431" length="8"></location><text>Pro71Ala</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs692243</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16644865</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic variation in IL6 gene and type 2 diabetes: tagging-SNP haplotype analysis in large-scale case-control study and meta-analysis.		Interleukin-6 (IL-6, gene symbol IL6) is a proinflammatory cytokine. High circulating IL-6 levels have been associated with insulin resistance and greater risk of type 2 diabetes. Using a linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based approach, we sought to investigate the associations of the common polymorphisms comprehensively defining the genetic variability at the IL6 locus with diabetes risk. We conducted a case-control study of 2691 cases of type 2 diabetes (1692 women and 999 men) and 3237 control subjects (2238 women and 999 men) from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professional Follow-up Study. Pairwise LD analysis indicated that all the IL6 polymorphisms (rs2069827, rs1800797, rs1800795, rs1554606, rs2069849, rs2069861 and rs1818879) were in strong LD. We did not find significant associations between IL6 polymorphisms and the risk of type 2 diabetes in women or men, individually or in haplotypes. In addition, none of the IL6 polymorphisms was significantly associated with the plasma levels of IL-6 in the control subjects. Our meta-analysis of 5383 diabetes case and 12 069 controls indicated a null association between the best-studied 5' promoter polymorphism--174G&gt;C (rs1800795)--and diabetes risk. Diversity in adiposity, age and sex could not account for the heterogeneity across different studies. In summary, the data in this study do not support substantial associations between the common polymorphisms in IL6 gene and circulating IL-6 levels and the risk of type 2 diabetes.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1318" length="8"></location><text>-174G&gt;C </text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1800795</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18353052</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Germ-line mutation of KCNQ2, p.R213W, in a Japanese family with benign familial neonatal convulsion.		BACKGROUND: Benign familial neonatal convulsion (BFNC) is an autosomal-dominantly inherited epilepsy of neonates. The KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes have been cloned as the responsible genes for BFNC. Detection of mutations in these genes is helpful for confirmation of BFNC or differential diagnosis of convulsive disorders in the neonatal period. METHODS: A Japanese family with BFNC was investigated. Two siblings were clinically diagnosed as having BFNC. KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were screened for mutations using a combination of polymerase chain reaction and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. Nucleotide substitutions were confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: In the affected siblings a C-to-T heterozygous substitution was detected at nucleotide 683 (c.683C&gt;T) in KCNQ2, leading to substitution of arginine with tryptophan at amino acid position 213 (p.R213W) in the S4 voltage-sensing domain of the KCNQ2 protein. The detected mutation may disrupt this highly conserved region among potassium channel proteins. The c.683C&gt;T substitution in KCNQ2 was not present in the parents. KCNQ3 was also analyzed and a single nucleotide polymorphism, c.1241A&gt;G (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), SNP ID: rs2303995), was detected in the index family. CONCLUSIONS: Two siblings with BFNC had a novel heterozygous missense mutation, p.R213W, in KCNQ2. This mutation may affect potassium gating, leading to neuronal excitability or convulsions in the patients. Furthermore, neither of the parents had the p.R213W mutation, indicating that it was a germ-line mutation. The possibility of recurrence of such a germ-line mutation in the next siblings should be explained during genetic counseling.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1253" length="9"></location><text>c.1241A&gt;G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2303995</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17916900</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in selected cytokine genes and risk of adult glioma.		A role of immunological factors in glioma etiology is suggested by reports of an inverse relationship with history of allergy or autoimmune disease. To test whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes were related to risk of adult glioma, we genotyped 11 SNPs in seven cytokine genes within a hospital-based study conducted by the National Cancer Institute and an independent, population-based study by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (overall 756 cases and 1190 controls with blood samples). The IL4 (rs2243248, -1098T&gt;G) and IL6 (rs1800795, -174G&gt;C) polymorphisms were significantly associated with risk of glioma in the pooled analysis (P trend = 0.006 and 0.04, respectively), although these became attenuated after controlling for the false discovery rate (P trend = 0.07 and 0.22, respectively). Our results underscore the importance of pooled analyses in genetic association studies and suggest that SNPs in cytokine genes may influence susceptibility to glioma.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="646" length="8"></location><text>-1098T&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="676" length="7"></location><text>-174G&gt;C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2243248</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1800795</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18086758</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms in hormone metabolism and DNA repair genes and epithelial ovarian cancer: results from two Australian studies and an additional validation set.		Although some high-risk ovarian cancer genes have been identified, it is likely that common low penetrance alleles exist that confer some increase in ovarian cancer risk. We have genotyped nine putative functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in genes involved in steroid hormone synthesis (SRD5A2, CYP19A1, HSB17B1, and HSD17B4) and DNA repair (XRCC2, XRCC3, BRCA2, and RAD52) using two Australian ovarian cancer case-control studies, comprising a total of 1,466 cases and 1,821 controls of Caucasian origin. Genotype frequencies in cases and controls were compared using logistic regression. The only SNP we found to be associated with ovarian cancer risk in both of these two studies was SRD5A2 V89L (rs523349), which showed a significant trend of increasing risk per rare allele (P = 0.00002). We then genotyped another SNP in this gene (rs632148; r(2) = 0.945 with V89L) in an attempt to validate this finding in an independent set of 1,479 cases and 2,452 controls from United Kingdom, United States, and Denmark. There was no association between rs632148 and ovarian cancer risk in the validation samples, and overall, there was no significant heterogeneity between the results of the five studies. Further analyses of SNPs in this gene are therefore warranted to determine whether SRD5A2 plays a role in ovarian cancer predisposition.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="904" length="4"></location><text>V89L</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs523349</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18303204</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Body mass index is associated with USF1 haplotype in Korean premenopausal women.

Lumbar-disc herniation (LDH), one of the most common musculoskeletal diseases, has strong genetic determinants. Recently, several genes that encode extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the intervertebral disc have been reported to associate with LDH. Thrombospondins (THBSs) 1 and 2 are good candidates for the LDH susceptibility gene: They are intervertebral disc ECM proteins that regulate the effective levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9, which are key effectors of ECM remodeling. Here, we report that THBS2 is associated with LDH in Japanese populations. An intronic SNP in THBS2 (IVS10-8C --&gt; T; rs9406328) showed significant association (p = 0.0000028) with LDH in two independent Japanese populations. This SNP, located in a polypyrimidine tract upstream of the 3' splice site of intron 10, exerts allelic differences on exon 11 skipping rates in vivo, with the susceptibility allele showing increased skipping. Skipping of exon 11 results in decreased THBS2 interaction with MMP2 and MMP9. Further, a missense SNP in MMP9 (Q279R; rs17576) is also strongly associated with LDH in the Japanese population (p = 0.00049) and shows a combinatorial effect with THBS2 (odds ratio 3.03, 95% confidence interval 1.58-5.77). Thus, a splicing-affecting SNP in THBS2 and a missense SNP in MMP9 are associated with susceptibility to LDH. Our data indicate that regulation of intervertebral disc ECM metabolism by the THBS2-MMP system plays an essential role in the etiology and pathogenesis of LDH.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="733" length="14"></location><text>IVS10-8C --&gt; T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1179" length="5"></location><text>Q279R</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs9406328</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs17576</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17903298</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genome-wide association with diabetes-related traits in the Framingham Heart Study.		BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to type 2 diabetes may be conferred by genetic variants having modest effects on risk. Genome-wide fixed marker arrays offer a novel approach to detect these variants. METHODS: We used the Affymetrix 100K SNP array in 1,087 Framingham Offspring Study family members to examine genetic associations with three diabetes-related quantitative glucose traits (fasting plasma glucose (FPG), hemoglobin A1c, 28-yr time-averaged FPG (tFPG)), three insulin traits (fasting insulin, HOMA-insulin resistance, and 0-120 min insulin sensitivity index); and with risk for diabetes. We used additive generalized estimating equations (GEE) and family-based association test (FBAT) models to test associations of SNP genotypes with sex-age-age2-adjusted residual trait values, and Cox survival models to test incident diabetes. RESULTS: We found 415 SNPs associated (at p &lt; 0.001) with at least one of the six quantitative traits in GEE, 242 in FBAT (18 overlapped with GEE for 639 non-overlapping SNPs), and 128 associated with incident diabetes (31 overlapped with the 639) giving 736 non-overlapping SNPs. Of these 736 SNPs, 439 were within 60 kb of a known gene. Additionally, 53 SNPs (of which 42 had r2 &lt; 0.80 with each other) had p &lt; 0.01 for incident diabetes AND (all 3 glucose traits OR all 3 insulin traits, OR 2 glucose traits and 2 insulin traits); of these, 36 overlapped with the 736 other SNPs. Of 100K SNPs, one (rs7100927) was in moderate LD (r2 = 0.50) with TCF7L2 (rs7903146), and was associated with risk of diabetes (Cox p-value 0.007, additive hazard ratio for diabetes = 1.56) and with tFPG (GEE p-value 0.03). There were no common (MAF &gt; 1%) 100K SNPs in LD (r2 &gt; 0.05) with ABCC8 A1369S (rs757110), KCNJ11 E23K (rs5219), or SNPs in CAPN10 or HNFa. PPARG P12A (rs1801282) was not significantly associated with diabetes or related traits.

This study evaluated the ability of polymorphisms in five candidate genes to predict weight gain among patients taking bupropion or placebo in a smoking cessation trial. Five hundred fifty-three smokers were enrolled into a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and followed for 12 months. Five candidate genes [DRD2 Taq1 (rs1800497), DRD2-141 (rs1799732), C957T (rs6277), COMT (rs4818), and SLC6A3] were genotyped. Weights at baseline, at end of treatment, and after 6 and 12 months of follow-up were self-reported. Smoking abstinence at each endpoint was self-reported and confirmed biochemically. A self-reported average weight gain after 12 months of 1.1 +/- 6.0 kg (mean +/- standard deviation) in the bupropion group and 1.8 +/- 4.8 kg in the placebo group was noted. For subjects with biochemically confirmed abstinence from smoking, the HL genotype (alleles coding Val at codon 108 are denoted as H, and those coding Met are denoted as L) at the COMT locus and A1A1 genotype at the DRD2 Taq1 locus were associated with less weight gain at the end of treatment. The TC genotype at the C957T locus was associated with increased weight gain at 6 months of follow-up. However, no polymorphisms or their interactions with bupropion consistently and significantly predicted baseline BMI or weight change during treatment for all study subjects. Overall, our results do not support a major role for these five candidate genes in weight gain after smoking cessation.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1179" length="5"></location><text>C957T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6277</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17374448</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Failure to confirm the association between the FEZ1 gene and schizophrenia in a Japanese population.

A previous association study that analyzed polymorphisms of the FEZ1 gene in Japanese patients with schizophrenia and control subjects found significant association of the Asp123Glu polymorphism with schizophrenia. In the present study, we examined two polymorphic markers, rs559668 and rs597570 (Asp123Glu), in the FEZ1 gene to confirm the association in 1920 Japanese patients with schizophrenia and 1920 control subjects. The power to detect an association was more than 0.98. However, we did not detect genotypic associations of either of these two single nucleotide polymorphisms with schizophrenia (p=1 and 0.79, respectively).

The catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene encodes enzymes that inactivate catechol estrogens and may have a protective role in estrogen-induced tumorigenesis, such as uterine leiomyoma (fibroids). Val158Met is a common single-nucleotide polymorphism of the COMT gene (Ex4-12 G&gt;A; rs4680) that results in a lower activity enzyme, increasing susceptibility to tumorigenesis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation between the COMTVal158Met polymorphism and uterine fibroids. Participants were 972 premenopausal African American (n = 576) and white (n = 396) women from a cross-sectional sample of women in the National Institute of Environmental Health Science's Uterine Fibroid Study. Blood was collected from participants for DNA, and telephone interviews and questionnaires were completed to gather demographic and reproductive history. Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using race-specific log-risk regression models. Effect measure modification by age, body mass index, oral contraceptive use, full-term births, smoking, and alcohol use were also evaluated. Distributions of genotypes and fibroid prevalence varied by race. No associations between fibroids and Val158Met were observed among African American or white participants. This study suggests that variation in this polymorphism alone does not affect fibroid prevalence.

RATIONALE: A common polymorphism, Val158Met, alters catechol- O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme activity and has been linked to psychiatric phenotypes. Bray et al. (2003) reported that COMT is subject to differential allele expression in brain, finding modest (13-22%) underexpression of a haplotype containing Val158. However, disparate findings by another group who used the same method, but in lymphoblasts, raise the issues of tissue specificity, magnitude of differential expression, and identity of loci altering expression. OBJECTIVES: We measured COMT allele expression ratios in heterozygous human lymphoblast cell lines and brains. METHODS: Using transcribed single nucleotide polymorphisms as endogenous reporters, we developed an RT-coupled 5' nuclease assay for allele expression ratios and applied it to 63 COMT rs4818(C&gt;G) heterozygotes and 68 Val158Met [rs4680(G&gt;A)] heterozygotes. RESULTS: For rs4818(C&gt;G), the C allele was overexpressed relative to the G allele in 18 of 27 lymphoblast lines and 23 of 36 brains. For Val158Met, Met158 was overexpressed relative to Val158 in all (29 of 29) lymphoblast lines and all (39 of 39) brains. Each of the 22 rs4818 heterozygotes without differential allele expression was a Val158/Val158 homozygote. The Met158 allele was overexpressed by 65-77% when compared with Val158 in lymphoblasts and brain. Haplotype augmented ability to predict expression in brain only. However, the expression of the Val158 allele on the high-expressing haplotype was only 19% higher than Val158 alleles on the other haplotype background. CONCLUSIONS: COMT alleles are differentially expressed. The Met158 allele predicts higher mRNA expression in both brain and lymphoblasts. As exemplified here, the RT-coupled 5' nuclease assay is a reliable method for the quantitative evaluation of cis-acting regulatory effects.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="149" length="9"></location><text>Val158Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4680</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18280297</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Two coding single nucleotide polymorphisms in the SALL1 gene in Townes-Brocks syndrome: a case report and review of the literature.

Mutations in SALL1, a gene mapping to chromosome 16q21.1, are responsible for TBS. Here, we described a 16-month-old male patient with typical TBS clinical features including imperforate anus and preaxial polydactyly. Two coding polymorphism sites were identified in this case. One is silent (rs1965024, 2574 C &gt; T), whereas the other yields a new codon encoding a different amino acid (rs4614723, 3823 G &gt; A). The hot spot mutations in exon 2 were not suggested. Therefore, lack of SALL1 gene mutations and the presence of variable phenotypes in the sporadic cases might suggest DNA alternations in the noncoding regions of SALL1 gene and/or in other genes modulating SALL1 gene expression or functions.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="623" length="10"></location><text>2574 C &gt; T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="717" length="10"></location><text>3823 G &gt; A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1965024</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4614723</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17096406</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Germ-line genetic variation of TP53 in osteosarcoma.

We hypothesized that genetic variation in TP53 could be associated with OS risk based on its critical role in cell growth and effect of somatic mutations in OS tumors. PROCEDURE: Twelve common SNPs in TP53 were genotyped in a case-control study of sporadic OS. These SNPs spanned the TP53 locus and captured common haplotypes. Genotype data were analyzed using contingency tables for additive, dominant, and recessive genetic models. PHASEv2.1 and HaploStats were used to evaluate haplotypes. RESULTS: The recessive model suggested an increased risk of OS when two copies of TP53-34 C&gt;G variant (IVS2+38, rs1642785) were present, P = 0.041, odds ratio (OR) 6.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-41.6). The TP53-01 variant C&gt;G (Pro72Arg, rs1042522) may also be associated with increased risk for OS, P = 0.028, OR 7.5 (95% CI 1.20-46.3). Common TP53 haplotypes as well as the remaining 10 SNPs were not associated with risk for OS. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not indicate a strong link between variation in TP53 and OS risk, although they provide preliminary evidence of an increased risk of OS associated with variants at IVS2+38 and Pro72Arg. The findings warrant replication in further studies.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="969" length="20"></location><text>C&gt;G variant (IVS2+38</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1522" length="8"></location><text>Pro72Arg</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1642785</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1042522</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17764108</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes, ionizing radiation exposure and risk of breast cancer in U.S. Radiologic technologists.		High-dose ionizing radiation exposure to the breast and rare autosomal dominant genes have been linked with increased breast cancer risk, but the role of low-to-moderate doses from protracted radiation exposure in breast cancer risk and its potential modification by polymorphisms in DNA repair genes has not been previously investigated among large numbers of radiation-exposed women with detailed exposure data. Using carefully reconstructed estimates of cumulative breast doses from occupational and personal diagnostic ionizing radiation, we investigated the potential modification of radiation-related breast cancer risk by 55 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms in 17 genes involved in base excision or DNA double-strand break repair among 859 cases and 1083 controls from the United States Radiologic Technologists (USRT) cohort. In multivariable analyses, WRN V114I (rs2230009) significantly modified the association between cumulative occupational breast dose and risk of breast cancer (adjusted for personal diagnostic exposure) (p = 0.04) and BRCA1 D652N (rs4986850), PRKDC IVS15 + 6C &gt; T (rs1231202), PRKDC IVS34 + 39T &gt; C (rs8178097) and PRKDC IVS31 - 634C &gt; A (rs10109984) significantly altered the personal diagnostic radiation exposure-response relationship (adjusted for occupational dose) (p &lt; or = 0.05). None of the remaining 50 SNPs significantly modified breast cancer radiation dose-response relationships. The USRT genetic study provided a unique opportunity to examine the joint effects of common genetic variation and ionizing radiation exposure on breast cancer risk using detailed occupational and personal diagnostic exposure data. The suggestive evidence found for modification of radiation-related breast cancer risk for 5 of the 55 SNPs evaluated requires confirmation in larger studies of women with quantified radiation breast doses in the low-to-moderate range.</text><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1249" length="15"></location><text>IVS34 + 39T &gt; C</text></annotation><annotation id="T5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="998" length="5"></location><text>V114I</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1190" length="5"></location><text>D652N</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1287" length="16"></location><text>IVS31 - 634C &gt; A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1215" length="14"></location><text>IVS15 + 6C &gt; T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4986850</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1231202</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#5"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2230009</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T5" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs8178097</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs10109984</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16553027</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Polymorphisms of estrogen receptor beta gene are associated with hypospadias.		INTRODUCTION: Hypospadias is a common male congenital urethral malformation, defined as the displacement of the urethral meatus ventrally from the tip of the glans penis. The importance of androgen receptor in male external genitalia development has been well recognized. Recently, the presence of active estrogen receptors (ER) in the developing male external genitalia has also been demonstrated. There are two isoforms of the human estrogen receptor, ESR1 and ESR2, which occur, with distinct tissue and cell patterns of expression. We hypothesized that modifications in these nuclear receptors' genes could lead to hypospadias. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened 60 boys with hypospadias for mutations in the coding regions of ESR1 and ESR2 genes, by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and automated sequence analysis. We also genotyped the CA repeat polymorphism in ESR2 and the TA repeat polymorphism in ESR1. RESULTS: The CA repeat polymorphism in ESR2 is prolonged in hypospadias patients compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05). Prolongation of this CA repeat polymorphism has previously been associated with lower levels of testosterone. Six patients presented the genetic variant 2681-4A &gt; G (rs944050) in the heterozygous form in ESR2, which was a significantly higher frequency than in the control population (p &lt; 0.05). One of these patients also presented a 266_267insC in exon 1 of ESR2, which is also a known single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs3832949). In ESR1, no significant gene alteration was found to be associated with hypospadias. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that variations in the ESR2 might influence susceptibility to hypospadias.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1277" length="11"></location><text>2681-4A &gt; G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs944050</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16264183</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>A putative exonic splicing polymorphism in the BCL6 gene and the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.		Recent studies have shown that the B-cell lymphoma 6 gene (BCL6) is an oncogene that contributes to lymphomagenesis. Exon 6 of BCL6 contains a common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (-195 C&gt;T; dbSNP ID: rs1056932) that alters a potential binding site for an exonic splicing enhancer. We used unconditional logistic regression models to examine the association between this SNP and the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in a population-based case-control study of women residing in Connecticut (461 case patients and 535 control subjects). The risk of NHL among women with the CC genotype was more than double that of women with the TT genotype (odds ratio [OR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5 to 3.3). Higher risks were observed for two NHL subtypes, namely B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia/prolymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.6 to 7.8) and T-cell lymphoma (OR = 5.2, 95% CI = 2.0 to 13.3). Our results support the hypothesis that a genetic variant that could alter mRNA transcripts of BCL6 may contribute to the etiology of NHL and suggest that this variant warrants further investigation.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="284" length="8"></location><text>-195 C&gt;T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1056932</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17221838</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene polymorphisms with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).		We serendipitously identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), 8636C&gt;A (rs1804197) in the 3'-untranslated region of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene to be associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In order to gain further evidence for the association between the APC locus and ASD, we genotyped four additional adjacent common SNPs (rs2229992, rs42427, rs459552, and rs465899) in the coding regions within the APC gene in a set of Swedish ASDs and controls. One common haplotype TGAG was found to be associated with ASD after haplotype analysis using both Haploview v3.1.1 (P = 0.006) and COCAPHASE v2.403 (P = 0.030).

AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Mutations at the gene encoding wolframin (WFS1) cause Wolfram syndrome, a rare neurological condition. Associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at WFS1 and type 2 diabetes have recently been reported. Thus, our aim was to replicate those associations in a northern Swedish case-control study of type 2 diabetes. We also performed a meta-analysis of published and previously unpublished data from Sweden, Finland and France, to obtain updated summary effect estimates. METHODS: Four WFS1 SNPs (rs10010131, rs6446482, rs752854 and rs734312 [H611R]) were genotyped in a type 2 diabetes case-control study (n = 1,296/1,412) of Swedish adults. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between each WFS1 SNP and type 2 diabetes, following adjustment for age, sex and BMI. We then performed a meta-analysis of 11 studies of type 2 diabetes, comprising up to 14,139 patients and 16,109 controls, to obtain a summary effect estimate for the WFS1 variants. RESULTS: In the northern Swedish study, the minor allele at rs752854 was associated with reduced type 2 diabetes risk [odds ratio (OR) 0.85, 95% CI 0.75-0.96, p=0.010]. Borderline statistical associations were observed for the remaining SNPs. The meta-analysis of the four independent replication studies for SNP rs10010131 and correlated variants showed evidence for statistical association (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.93, p=4.5 x 10(-5)). In an updated meta-analysis of all 11 studies, strong evidence of statistical association was also observed (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.86-0.92; p=4.9 x 10(-11)). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In this study of WFS1 variants and type 2 diabetes risk, we have replicated the previously reported associations between SNPs at this locus and the risk of type 2 diabetes.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="685" length="5"></location><text>H611R</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs734312</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17606874</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of the vitamin D metabolism gene CYP27B1 with type 1 diabetes.		OBJECTIVE: Epidemiological studies have linked vitamin D deficiency with the susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. Higher levels of the active metabolite 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D) could protect from immune destruction of the pancreatic beta-cells. 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D is derived from its precursor 25-hydroxyvitamin D by the enzyme 1 alpha-hydroxylase encoded by the CYP27B1 gene and is inactivated by 24-hydroxylase encoded by the CYP24A1 gene. Our aim was to study the association between the CYP27B1 and CYP24A1 gene polymorphisms and type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 7,854 patients with type 1 diabetes, 8,758 control subjects from the U.K., and 2,774 affected families. We studied four CYP27B1 variants, including common polymorphisms -1260C&gt;A (rs10877012) and +2838T&gt;C (rs4646536) and 16 tag polymorphisms in the CYP24A1 gene. RESULTS: We found evidence of association with type 1 diabetes for CYP27B1 -1260 and +2838 polymorphisms, which are in perfect linkage disequilibrium. The common C allele of CYP27B1 -1260 was associated with an increased disease risk in the case-control analysis (odds ratio for the C/C genotype 1.22, P = 9.6 x 10(-4)) and in the fully independent collection of families (relative risk for the C/C genotype 1.33, P = 3.9 x 10(-3)). The combined P value for an association with type 1 diabetes was 3.8 x 10(-6). For the CYP24A1 gene, we found no evidence of association with type 1 diabetes (multilocus test, P = 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: The present data provide evidence that common inherited variation in the vitamin D metabolism affects susceptibility to type 1 diabetes.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="861" length="8"></location><text>-1260C&gt;A</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="887" length="8"></location><text>+2838T&gt;C</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs10877012</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs4646536</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17938376</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Effect of endothelin 1 genotype on blood pressure is dependent on physical activity or fitness levels.		Contributions of the DNA sequence variation at the endothelin 1 locus to the risk of hypertension and to endurance training-induced changes in blood pressure were investigated in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study and the Health, Risk Factors, Exercise Training and Genetics Family Study cohorts. We identified 586 normotensive control subjects and 607 incident hypertensive case subjects from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study cohort (all whites) who were normotensive and healthy at their first clinic visit. The case subjects were diagnosed with hypertension during an average follow-up of 9.5 years, whereas the control subjects remained normotensive. The allele and genotype frequencies of 5 endothelin 1 haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms did not differ significantly between the case and control subjects. However, we observed a significant (P=0.0025) interaction between the endothelin 1 rs5370 (G/T; Lys198Asn) genotype and cardiorespiratory fitness level on the risk of hypertension: among low-fit subjects, the rs5370 minor allele (T; 198Asn) was associated with higher risk of hypertension (odds ratio: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.36 to 2.81; P=0.0003), whereas the risk did not differ among genotypes in high-fit subjects. In the white Health, Risk Factors, Exercise Training and Genetics subjects (N=480), the rs5370 T allele was associated with blunted systolic blood pressure (P=0.0046) and pulse pressure (P=0.0016) responses to a 20-week endurance training program. The Lys198Asn variant of the endothelin 1 locus is associated with blood pressure phenotypes in whites. However, the expression of the genotype effect is modulated by physical activity or cardiorespiratory fitness level. Our study provides an illustrative example of how physical activity and fitness level modifies the associations between a candidate gene and outcome phenotype.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1037" length="9"></location><text>Lys198Asn</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5370</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18071027</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Genetic variation and association analyses of the nuclear respiratory factor 1 (nRF1) gene in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes.		OBJECTIVE: Nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) is a strong biological and positional candidate to contribute to type 2 diabetes susceptibility. This study aimed at evaluating associations between NRF1 genetic polymorphisms and development of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a variation screening approach, 6 novel and 10 known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NRF1 gene were identified. Nine SNPs were then selected using pairwise tagging with an r(2) cutoff of 0.8 and/or minor allele frequency of &gt;5% and genotyped in 596 type 2 diabetic patients and 431 nondiabetic subjects, all of whom were Han Chinese. RESULTS: Two novel SNPs (-46127T&gt;C and +98560A&gt;G) were associated with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.018 and 0.036; for possession of minor allele, odds ratio [OR] 0.620 and 3.199, with dominant model and correction for multiple comparisons). In SNP rs1882094 (+141G&gt;T), the nondiabetic control subjects carrying GG genotype had lower fasting plasma glucose levels than carriers with other genotypes (P = 0.0002). One common haplotype (H2) mainly composed of SNPs rs6969098 (-24833 A&gt;G), rs1882094, and another novel variant (+97884G&gt;A) was significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (P = 0.016, OR 0.706). Subjects with this haplotype had lower fasting triglyceride levels when compared with those with other haplotypes (P = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows an association of SNPs in the NRF1 gene with type 2 diabetes in a Han Chinese population. NRF1 genetic polymorphisms may be a suspectibility factor for type 2 diabetes by conferring abnormalities in triglyceride metabolism. Further studies should replicate this finding using larger and racially diverse populations.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1031" length="6"></location><text>141G&gt;T</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1244" length="10"></location><text>-24833 A&gt;G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1882094</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6969098</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17390150</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>PGC-1alpha Thr394Thr and Gly482Ser variants are significantly associated with T2DM in two North Indian populations: a replicate case-control study.		The recent observations that Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1A) is responsible for the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxifying agents and that ROS triggers insulin resistance, support the role that this gene could play in the onset of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Two PGC1A variants Thr394Thr (rs2970847) and Gly482Ser (rs8192673) were genotyped in 822 subjects (351 T2DM cases and 471 controls) from two North Indian populations, represented as Group 1 (Kashmir population) and Group 2 (Punjab and Jammu population). Both Groups 1 and 2 showed a significant association of Thr394Thr variant with T2DM after applying Bonferroni corrections (P=0.001 and 0.012, respectively). Logistic regression analysis for Thr394Thr susceptible genotypes together (rs2970847 G/A and A/A) conferred a 1.89-(95%CI 1.25-2.85) fold higher risk for T2DM in Group 1 and 1.81-(95%CI 1.19-2.78) fold risk in Group 2. The susceptible, Ser482 (rs8192673 G/A and A/A) genotypes, gave a 2.04 (95%CI 1.47-3.03) fold higher risk for T2DM in Group 1. Mitochondrial genotype backgrounds observed in association with T2DM (Bhat et al. 2007), when studied in combination with PGC1A variants, showed an increased prevalence in controls with mt10398G and 16189T along with G/G genotype background at the two polymorphic loci of PGC1A.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of a non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in DNASEI with susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the production of autoantibodies to nuclear antigens. METHODS: The Gln244Arg (rs1053874) SNP was studied in 276 SLE patients and in 368 healthy controls of Spanish ancestry. Its relationship with SLE susceptibility, serum DNase I activity, anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP), anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), anti-nucleosome and anti-single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) antibodies was determined. RESULTS: An association of the Gln244Arg SNP with SLE susceptibility that followed a recessive genetic model (P=0.002) was found. The GG genotype was more common in SLE patients (59.8%) than in controls (47.3%). However, the Gln244Arg genotype did not correlate with DNase I activity in sera from SLE patients or from controls. In addition, the Gln244Arg SNP did not influence autoantibody titres significantly. CONCLUSION: The association of the Gln244Arg SNP with SLE susceptibility indicates that common polymorphisms in DNASEI play a role in the genetics of SLE. However, the lack of effect of the Gln244Arg SNP on serum DNase I activity calls into question the direct involvement of this specific SNP.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="338" length="9"></location><text>Gln244Arg</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1053874</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17171651</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Cyclooxygenase-2 polymorphisms in Parkinson's disease.		Accumulating evidence indicate that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is of pathophysiological importance for the neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). For example, in a large epidemiological study, use of NSAIDs was associated with a lower risk of PD. Genetic variants of the COX-2 gene might therefore influence the risk of developing the disease. The genotype distribution of four common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the COX-2 gene (rs689466:A496G, rs20417:G926C, rs5277:G3050C, rs5275:C8473T) was analyzed in PD patients and control subjects in a Swedish population. No differences could be seen between the PD-patient and controls regarding the A496G, G926C, and G3050C SNPs, but the allele frequency of the C8473T SNP was found to differ when male patients were compared to controls (P = 0.007). In females no difference could be seen between PD-patients and controls. In conclusion, the results suggest a possible influence of the COX-2 C8473T SNP in PD, although it only seems to be of importance in men.</text><annotation id="T4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="726" length="5"></location><text>G926C</text></annotation><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="719" length="5"></location><text>A496G</text></annotation><annotation id="T3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="737" length="6"></location><text>G3050C</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1013" length="6"></location><text>C8473T</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs689466</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5275</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#4"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs20417</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T4" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#3"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs5277</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T3" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17563728</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Fine mapping of new glaucoma locus GLC1M and exclusion of neuregulin 2 as the causative gene.		PURPOSE: We recently identified a novel glaucoma locus on 5q22.1-q32, designated as GLC1M, in a family from the Philippines with autosomal dominant juvenile-onset primary open angle glaucoma (JOAG). No mutations in myocilin (MYOC), optineurin (OPTN), and WD-repeat protein 36 (WDR36) were found. Neuregulin 2 (NRG2) is an excellent potential functional as well as positional candidate at GLC1M. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the role of the NRG2 gene in this JOAG family and unrelated JOAG patients and to refine the critical interval for GLC1M. METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained from 27 family members. All coding exons and splicing sites of NRG2 were screened for sequence alterations by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing. A cohort of 92 unrelated JOAG patients and 92 control subjects were genotyped for the three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NRG2 by PCR and DNA sequencing. Haplotype and segregation analyses were performed in the family. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the frequencies of the NRG2 polymorphisms between affected and unaffected subjects in the family and between unrelated JOAG patients and control subjects. RESULTS: Three SNPs were identified: c.98G&gt;A (S33N), IVS3+13A&gt;G (rs889022), and c.1976A&gt;G (G659G). None of them segregated with the JOAG phenotype in this family. No association was found between NRG2 and JOAG in the case-control study (p&gt;0.12). However, further inspection of the haplotypes in the family localized the NRG2 gene telomeric to the disease locus. The critical interval of GLC1M was therefore refined to a region of 28 Mb between D5S2051 and NRG2. CONCLUSIONS: The linkage interval for GLC1M was refined to a smaller region. The NRG2 gene was excluded as the causative gene for JOAG.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="1332" length="10"></location><text>IVS3+13A&gt;G</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs889022</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16832637</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Evaluation of interleukin 13 polymorphisms in systemic sclerosis.		Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a multisystem disease of unknown etiology. It is characterized by excessive cutaneous and visceral fibrosis, damage to small blood vessels, and production of autoantibodies. Interleukin-13 (IL-13) has been shown to be involved in abnormal fibrosis in other diseases. Therefore, we have evaluated its possible involvement in SSc. We analyzed four IL13 gene polymorphisms, rs1800925 (IL13-1055), rs20541 (Arg130Gln), rs847, and rs2243204 in 107 unrelated SSc patients (40 patients having diffuse cutaneous form and 67 patients having limited cutaneous form) and in 170 controls. All subjects were Caucasians. In the total patient population and in the diffuse cutaneous subset, we observed an association between two IL13 polymorphisms, IL13 rs1800925 (IL13-1055), and IL13 rs2243204, and disease (p=0.03-0.04). The IL13 rs2243204T allele was more common in SSc patients (p=0.01, OR=2.3 CI 1.21-4.38) and in the diffuse cutaneous form (p=0.01, OR=2.95, CI 1.35-6.49) than in control subjects. Our result supports the suggestion that polymorphisms in IL13 are associated to SSc and skin fibrosis process. However, further studies on larger and independent population and functional analyses are needed to confirm these findings.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="498" length="9"></location><text>Arg130Gln</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs20541</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17957803</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association between lung cancer risk and single nucleotide polymorphisms in the first intron and codon 178 of the DNA repair gene, O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase.		The association between lung cancer risk and 2 polymorphisms, rs12268840 and rs2308327 (codon K178R), in the DNA repair protein, O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase, which are associated with interindividual differences in activity, have been investigated in 3 hospital-based case-control studies. Genotyping was carried out on 617 subjects of whom 255 had lung cancer. In 2 of the 3 series, there was a significant inverse association between the 178R allele and case status (p &lt; 0.05). In a meta-analysis, the odds ratio (95% CI) associated with the 178R allele relative to the 178K allele was 0.64 (0.45-0.92, p = 0.01) and 0.51 (0.24-1.11, p = 0.09) in fixed effects and random effects models, respectively. In a pooled analysis, after adjustment for sex, age, pack years and series, the OR (95% CI) for a heterozygote was 0.67 (0.45-1.01) and for a 178R homozygote was 0.10 (0.01-0.94); the trend for a decreased risk with the number of R alleles was significant (p = 0.008). This trend was particularly pronounced in heavy smokers (trend test p = 0.003), but not significant in light smokers (p = 0.73). There was no evidence of an association between rs12268840 and lung cancer risk. These results suggest that the R allele may protect against lung cancer, specifically in heavy smokers, an effect that may result from this polymorphism affecting the function of the MGMT protein and/or levels in MGMT activity.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="264" length="5"></location><text>K178R</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs2308327</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>18222353</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Association of the Trp719Arg polymorphism in kinesin-like protein 6 with myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease in 2 prospective trials: the CARE and WOSCOPS trials.		OBJECTIVES: We asked whether 35 genetic polymorphisms, previously found to be associated with cardiovascular disease, were associated with myocardial infarction (MI) in the CARE (Cholesterol and Recurrent Events) trial and with coronary heart disease (CHD) in the WOSCOPS (West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study) trial and whether the risk associated with these polymorphisms could be reduced by pravastatin treatment. BACKGROUND: Identification of genetic polymorphisms associated with CHD may improve assessment of CHD risk and understanding of disease pathophysiology. METHODS: We tested the association between genotype and recurrent MI in the CARE study and between genotype and primary CHD in the WOSCOPS trial using regression models that adjusted for conventional risk factors: Cox proportional hazards models for the CARE study and conditional logistic regression models for a nested case-control study of the WOSCOPS trial. RESULTS: We found that Trp719Arg (rs20455) in KIF6 was associated with coronary events. KIF6 encodes kinesin-like protein 6, a member of the molecular motor superfamily. In placebo-treated patients, carriers of the KIF6 719Arg allele (59.4% of the CARE trial cohort) had a hazard ratio of 1.50 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05 to 2.15) in the CARE trial and an odds ratio of 1.55 (95% CI 1.14 to 2.09) in the WOSCOPS trial. Among carriers, the absolute risk reduction by pravastatin was 4.89% (95% CI 1.81% to 7.97%) in the CARE trial and 5.49% (95% CI 3.52% to 7.46%) in the WOSCOPS trial. CONCLUSIONS: In both the CARE and the WOSCOPS trials, carriers of the KIF6 719Arg allele had an increased risk of coronary events, and pravastatin treatment substantially reduced that risk.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="19" length="9"></location><text>Trp719Arg</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs20455</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17602759</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Immune cell BDNF secretion is associated with white matter volume in multiple sclerosis.		PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between immune cell secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) with clinical and MRI variables in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. BACKGROUND: BDNF exerts beneficial effects on neuronal growth and repair and is secreted by both neurons and immune cells. Consequently, it may mediate the crosstalk between the immune system and CNS in autoimmune diseases such as MS. METHODS: Fifty-two relapsing MS patients (41 females, age: 48.8+/-6.6 years, disease duration: 12.7+/-8.4 years) were enrolled. Clinical and MRI measurements (including, T1-, T2- and contrast-enhancing (CE) lesion volumes (LVs); normalized measures of whole brain, white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) volumes; diffusion weighted imaging measure of mean whole brain (WB) parenchyma diffusivity and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) measures were obtained. RESULTS: Immune cell BDNF secretion after anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 stimulation was positively associated with increased CE-LV (p=0.026). The MTR of CE-LV and normal-appearing (NA) WM (NAWM) were negatively associated with immune cell BDNF secretion after anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 stimulation. Immune cell BDNF secretion after anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 was positively associated with higher WM volume (p=0.027). Immune cell BDNF secretion after anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 stimulation was decreased with increasing disease duration (p=0.031). The BDNF secretion was independent of the BDNF Val66Met (dBSNP ID: rs6265) SNP genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Immune cell BDNF secretion is associated with the sites of higher inflammatory activity as evidenced by CE lesions and may represent an important factor associated with the WM volume of patients with MS.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1549" length="8"></location><text>Val66Met</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs6265</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15734977</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Gene-smoking interaction associations for the ERCC1 polymorphisms in the risk of lung cancer.		Cigarette smoking may induce DNA damage. Lower DNA repair capacities have been associated with higher risk of lung cancer. Excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1) is the lead enzyme in the nucleotide excision repair process, and low expression of ERCC1 mRNA levels has been associated with higher risk of cancers. We examined the association between two polymorphisms of ERCC1, 8092C &gt; A (rs3212986) and 19007T &gt; C (codon 118, rs11615), which are associated with altered ERCC1 mRNA stability and mRNA levels, in 1,752 Caucasian lung cancer patients and 1,358 controls. The results were analyzed using logistic regression models, adjusting for relevant covariates. The two polymorphisms were in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium and in linkage disequilibrium. There was no overall association between ERCC1 polymorphisms and lung cancer risk, with the adjusted odds ratios (AOR) of 1.26 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.81-1.96] for the 8092C &gt; A polymorphism (A/A versus C/C) and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.67-1.30) for the 19007T &gt; C polymorphism (C/C versus T/T). Stratified analyses revealed that the AORs for the 8092C &gt; A polymorphism (A/A versus C/C) decreased significantly as pack-years increased, with the AOR of 2.11 (95% CI, 1.03-4.31) in never smokers and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.25-1.01) in heavy smokers (&gt;/=56 pack-years), respectively. Consistent results were found when gene-smoking interaction was incorporated by joint effects and interactions models that considered both discrete and continuous variables for cumulative smoking exposure. The same direction for the gene-smoking interaction was found for the 19007T &gt; C polymorphism, although the interaction was not statistically significant. In conclusion, ERCC1 8092C &gt; A polymorphism may modify the associations between cumulative cigarette smoking and lung cancer risk.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="511" length="10"></location><text>19007T &gt; C</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="485" length="9"></location><text>8092C &gt; A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs11615</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3212986</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17983380</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>STAT1 gene variations, IgE regulation and atopy.		BACKGROUND: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), an intracellular signal transducer and activator of transcription centrally involved in many inflammatory pathways, was recently suggested to play an important role in allergy related immune responses. AIM: Thus, we investigated the effect of polymorphisms in the STAT1 gene on the development of atopic sensitization and allergic diseases. METHODS: Haplotype tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously described in the STAT1 gene were genotyped by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry technology in a cross-sectional study population of 3099 German children recruited and phenotyped by the International Study of Asthma and Allergy in Childhood, phase II (ISAAC II). Effects of single SNPs and haplotypes were studied using SAS/Genetics and Haploview. RESULTS: The polymorphism C39134A (rs3771300), located in a potentially cis acting regulatory element in STAT1 intron 24, was inversely related to atopy measured by skin prick test, total and specific serum IgE levels while no effect on atopic disease risk was observed. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that STAT1 SNP C39134A may protect from atopic sensitization. Because of its location in a highly conserved noncoding sequence near a putative GATA3 binding site, this polymorphism represents an interesting target for further studies.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="956" length="7"></location><text>C39134A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3771300</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>16670163</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Heritability of serum resistin and its genetic correlation with insulin resistance-related features in nondiabetic Caucasians.		CONTEXT: Serum levels of resistin are believed to modulate insulin resistance in humans. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum resistin levels are genetically controlled and whether this control is shared with other insulin resistance traits. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study cohort included 264 nondiabetic probands, Caucasian from Italy, and their 473 adult family members. Phenotypic characterization included anthropometric variables, blood pressure, fasting glucose and insulin, lipid profile, and resistin levels. Genotypes were determined at position g.-420C--&gt;G (rs1862513), IVS2+181G--&gt;A (rs3745367), and GAT((n)) polymorphisms of the resistin (RETN) gene. RESULTS: In the 264 unrelated probands, resistin levels were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) correlated with adiposity, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, and the metabolic syndrome score. In a variance component analysis of the 264 probands and their 473 relatives, about 70% of the observed variation of serum resistin levels was heritable (P &lt; 0.0001). A small, but significant (P = 0.004) proportion of this variance was explained by the G--&gt;A variation at position IVS2+181 of the RETN gene. Significant genetic correlations (P &lt; 0.05) were observed between resistin and body mass index (rho(g) = 0.30), waist circumference (rho(g) = 0.32), the insulin resistance index HOMA(IR) (rho(g) = 0.28), and the metabolic syndrome score (rho(g) = 0.35). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that serum resistin is highly heritable and has some common genetic background with traits related to insulin resistance, reinforcing the hypothesis that this adipokine may play a pathogenic role in insulin resistance-related abnormalities, including type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="711" length="11"></location><text>g.-420C--&gt;G</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">NSM</infon><location offset="736" length="13"></location><text>IVS2+181G--&gt;A</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1862513</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs3745367</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>17580110</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Linkage and mutational analysis of CLCN2 in childhood absence epilepsy.		In order to assess the chloride channel gene CLCN2 as a candidate susceptibility gene for childhood absence epilepsy, parametric and non-parametric linkage analysis was performed in 65 nuclear pedigrees. This provided suggestive evidence for linkage with heterogeneity: NPL score=2.3, p&lt;0.009; HLOD=1.5, alpha=0.44. Mutational analysis of the entire genomic sequence of CLCN2 was performed in 24 unrelated patients from pedigrees consistent with linkage, identifying 45 sequence variants including the known non-synonymous polymorphism rs2228292 (G2154C, Glu718Asp) and a novel variant IVS4+12G&gt;A. Intra-familial association analysis using the pedigrees and a further 308 parent-child trios showed suggestive evidence for transmission disequilibrium of the G2154C minor allele: AVE-PDT chi(1)2 = 5.17, p&lt;0.03. Case-control analysis provided evidence for a protective effect of the IVS4+12G&gt;A minor allele: chi(1)2 = 7.27, p&lt;0.008. The 65 nuclear pedigrees were screened for three previously identified mutations shown to segregate with a variety of idiopathic generalised epilepsy phenotypes (597insG, IVS2-14del11 and G2144A) but none were found.

Linkage analyses of bipolar families have confirmed that there is a susceptibility locus near the telomere on chromosome 21q. To fine map this locus we carried out tests of allelic association using 30 genetic markers near the telomere at 21q22.3 in 600 bipolar research subjects and 450 ancestrally matched supernormal control subjects. We found significant allelic association with the microsatellite markers D21S171 (P=0.016) and two closely linked single-nucleotide polymorphisms, rs1556314 (P=0.008) and rs1785467 (P=0.025). A test of association with a three locus haplotype across the susceptibility region was significant with a permutation test of P=0.011. A two SNP haplotype was also significantly associated with bipolar disorder (P=0.01). Only two brain expressed genes, TRPM2 and C21ORF29 (TSPEAR), are present in the associated region. TRPM2 encodes a calcium channel receptor and TSPEAR encodes a peptide with repeats associated with epilepsy in the mouse. DNA from subjects who had inherited the associated marker alleles was sequenced. A base pair change (rs1556314) in exon 11 of TRPM2, which caused a change from an aspartic acid to a glutamic acid at peptide position 543 was found. This SNP showed the strongest association with bipolar disorder (P=0.008). Deletion of exon 11 of TRPM2 is known to cause dysregulation of cellular calcium homeostasis in response to oxidative stress. A second nonconservative change from arginine to cysteine at position 755 in TRPM2 (ss48297761) was also detected. A third nonconservative change from histidine to glutamic acid was found in exon 8 of TSPEAR. These changes need further investigation to establish any aetiological role in bipolar disorder.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1623" length="36"></location><text>arginine to cysteine at position 755</text></annotation><annotation id="T2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="1317" length="56"></location><text>aspartic acid to a glutamic acid at peptide position 543</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs35288229</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation><relation id="#2"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs1556314</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T2" role=""></node></relation></passage></document><document><id>15939883</id><passage><offset>0</offset><text>Variation in DISC1 affects hippocampal structure and function and increases risk for schizophrenia.		Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is a promising schizophrenia candidate gene expressed predominantly within the hippocampus. We typed 12 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that covered the DISC1 gene. A three-SNP haplotype [hCV219779 (C)-rs821597 (G)-rs821616 (A)] spanning 83 kb of the gene was associated with schizophrenia in a family-based sample (P = 0.002). A common nonconservative SNP (Ser704Cys) (rs821616) within this haplotype was associated with schizophrenia (P = 0.004). Based on primary expression of DISC1 in hippocampus, we hypothesized that allelic variation at Ser704Cys would have a measurable impact on hippocampal structure and function as assayed via specific hippocampus-related intermediate phenotypes. In addition to overtransmission in schizophrenia, the Ser allele was associated with altered hippocampal structure and function in healthy subjects, including reduced hippocampal gray matter volume and altered engagement of the hippocampus during several cognitive tasks assayed with functional magnetic resonance imaging. These convergent data suggest that allelic variation within DISC1, either at Ser704Cys or haplotypes monitored by it, increases the risk for schizophrenia and that the mechanism of this effect involves structural and functional alterations in the hippocampal formation.</text><annotation id="T1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="type">PSM</infon><location offset="503" length="9"></location><text>Ser704Cys</text></annotation><relation id="#1"><infon key="file">ann</infon><infon key="string">rs821616</infon><infon key="note type">AnnotatorNotes</infon><infon key="type">Note</infon><node refid="T1" role=""></node></relation></passage></document></collection>
