IEPA_d24,"The aim of the present study was to investigate how oxytocin given subcutaneously (SC) and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) influences the secretion of insulin, glucagon and glucose and to investigate whether the effect on these variables of suckling in lactating rats is mediated by oxytocinergic mechanisms
Subcutaneous injections of oxytocin increased insulin, glucagon and glucose levels significantly
Two nanograms oxytocin given ICV had no effect on glucagon and glucose levels but caused a significant rise in insulin levels at this time point
The oxytocin antagonist 1-deamino-2-D-Tyr-(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Orn-oxytocin administered ICV increased insulin levels itself and therefore the effect on oxytocin-induced insulin secretion was difficult to evaluate
